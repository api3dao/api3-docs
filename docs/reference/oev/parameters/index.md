## Variable Parameters

OEV relay parameters can be either chain-specific or data feed proxy-specific.
You can query the [configuration endpoint](../api/#configuration) to see their
values. All time periods are in milliseconds unless specified otherwise.

### Auction Delay

::: info

This parameter is proxy-specific.

:::

The time period before bids are processed for the same data feed. This will be
longer than the chain's block time, but ideally as close to it as possible while
still giving searchers a reasonable time to land their transaction on-chain.

### Update Period

::: info

This parameter is proxy-specific.

:::

The time period searchers have to update the data feed after they have won an
auction. If they do not perform the update within this period, they will be
[slashed](#slashing) (provided there was no other update on that data feed
within the update period).

### Minimal Bid Amount

::: info

This parameter is proxy-specific.

:::

The minimal amount in native tokens for a bid. Placing a bid with a lower amount
will fail.

### Minimal Block Confirmations

::: info

This parameter is chain-specific.

:::

A number of block confirmations that must have passed for the OEV relay to
acknowledge blockchain events.

<!-- Commented out as it's currently not available via the /configuration endpoint -->
<!-- ### Bid Collateral

::: info

This parameter is data feed proxy specific.

:::

The percentage of USDC collateral relative to the bid amount that needs to be
posted in PrepaymentDepositor for a bid to win an auction. Also the amount
of funds that can be slashed upon misbehavior.

### API3 Fee

::: info

This parameter is data feed proxy specific.

:::

The amount of USDC taken from the searcher's collateral upon a successful update
to compensate data providers and the DAO. Will be smaller than or equal to the
bid collateral. No fee is taken if the searcher is frontrun by another searcher
or the oracle. Represented as a percentage of the bid amount. -->

## Fixed Parameters

OEV relay parameters that are the same for all chains.

### Withdraw Period

The time period searchers have to withdraw funds after they have been given a
signed message that allows them to do so by calling the
[`/withdraw` endpoint](../api/index.md#withdraw). **Set to 1 hour**. During this
period, the funds are reserved for withdrawal and cannot be used as collateral.

If the transaction is not made within the given timeframe, the relay will expire
the withdrawal and unreserve the funds back to the searcher.

## Other Terms

### Slashing

When a searcher makes a bid and the BE has filled it (i.e., they have won an
auction), a percentage of the bid amount is reserved from their available funds
as collateral for potential slashing. If the data feed is not updated within the
update period, the searcher is slashed, meaning the reserved funds are not
freed.
