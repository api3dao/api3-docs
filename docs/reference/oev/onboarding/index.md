Searcher onboarding notes:
Searchers/mev bot operators should continue to run their old software as a backup or fallback in the case that the OEV Relay experiences downtime. Opportunities such as liquidations or arbitrage will be able to be executed by the old searcher software in the same way as they were before the application integrated OEV data feeds.

Integrating the OEV auction may differ from current MEV architecture in that it expects searchers to be aware of which off-chain prices will trigger MEV opportunities and the value of them, instead of for example reacting to oracle updates in the mempool and being able to simulate MEV opportunities that they will cause on the current blockchain state. If you would like to integrate OEV auctions in a similiar way to the example above where you can simulate oracle updates seen in the mempool, you could use an API such as Coingecko as a replacement for the mempool and simulate their current prices against blockchain state. Then when you have simulated a valid MEV oppprtunity you can place bids to the OEV relay, note that you should continue to simulate for the presence of these opportunities while you have an open bid so that you can cancel the bid if the opportunity dissapears.
