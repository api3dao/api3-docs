# {{$frontmatter.title}}

As part of the Airnode deployment you can decide to deploy two different HTTP
Gateways.

- HTTP Gateway: testing
- HTTP Signed Data Gateway: production use

## Gateway Differences

Both gateways are setup identically. The differences are in their purpose and
response.

### HTTP Gateway

The regular HTTP gateway is strictly for testing purposes. Using a simple tool
like CURL you can test that endpoints in the Airnode configuration are working
properly without accessing the blockchain.

In order to facilitate configuration and testing of parameters, HTTP gateway
requests have the following differences in handling when compared to blockchain
requests or requests to the HTTP signed data gateway:

1. When a request's API call is successful but then that response fails
   extraction and encoding, data are still returned. This is in contrast to the
   other types of requests for which only an error would be returned. The API
   call response, after undergoing any
   [post-processing](/reference/ois/next/processing.md), will be present in the
   `rawValue` field independent of encoding success or failure:

   ```json
   {
     "rawValue": {...}
   }
   ```

2. Reserved parameters are inaccessible in response pre/post processing. This is
   only relevant if reserved parameters are being _modified_ in pre/post
   processing (advanced use case).

### HTTP Signed Data Gateway

The HTTP signed data gateway is used for production purposes. While it is
executed in a similar way as the HTTP gateway, its response is signed and does
not contain a `rawValue` field. This gateway is executed by an off-chain code
source that may in turn push data to a blockchain.

## Setup

Enable either gateway in the `config.json` file fields
`nodeSettings.httpGateway` and `nodeSettings.httpSignedDataGateway`.

- **enabled**: A boolean to enable/disable the gateway.
- **maxConcurrency**: (optional) A number higher than zero that represents the
  maximum number of serverless function instance serving gateway requests. When
  omitted, there is no maximum concurrency set. This field is ignored for
  Airnode client gateways.
- **corsOrigins**: A list of allowed origins, `['*']` to allow all origins or an
  empty array to disable CORS.

```json
"nodeSettings": {
  "cloudProvider": {
    "type": "aws",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  },
  "airnodeWalletMnemonic": "${AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC}",
  "heartbeat": {...},
  "httpGateway": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  "httpSignedDataGateway": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  ...
},
```

Add the desired endpoints a gateway can respond to in the `triggers.http[n]`
and/or `triggers.httpSignedData[n]` arrays. The corresponding arrays do not need
to match. It could be practical to test all endpoints but only serve certain
endpoints using the HTTP signed data gateway or via RRP.

```json
// in config.json
"triggers": {
  ...
  "http": [ // This endpoint can be served
    {       // by the http gateway
      "endpointId": "0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    }
  ],
  "httpSignedData": [ // These endpoints can be served
    {                 // by the http httpSignedData
      "endpointId": "0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    },
    {
      "endpointId": "5f5fa09c81d543e04c92087ac3ffe479ad55a04961cf4c9b37d897568c7ae805",
      "oisTitle": "Market Indexes",
      "endpointName": "indexByName",
    }
  ]
}
```

## Gateway URLs

The gateway implementation is different depending on how Airnode is deployed.
When deployed on a cloud provider, the serverless gateway is used. Inside
Airnode client, the gateway is implemented via a simple web server inside the
docker container. There are subtle differences in both how the gateways work and
what the gateway URLs look like.

The deployer generates a secret `UUID` path parameter which ensures that the
endpoints are not openly accessible. Therefore, the gateway URLs should be kept
secret.

The gateway URLs are also available as part of the payload sent from Airnode's
[heartbeat](/reference/airnode/next/understand/heartbeat.md) to a specified
heartbeat URL.

### When deployed on a cloud provider

A gateway URL is generated for each gateway (when enabled) when Airnode is
deployed. The URL including, the secret `UUID` path parameter, is displayed on
the terminal at the end of an Airnode deployment using the
[Docker image](/reference/airnode/next/docker/deployer-image.md).

### When using Airnode client

Airnode client can be used to run Airnode as a docker container locally. There
is a common web server for both gateways, which is exposed on the host machine.
Doing so will make the gateways API accessible like a regular web server running
on the machine. Each gateway has a separate endpoint as shown below. Note the
`PORT` which is exposed as part of the Airnode client container. See the
[Airnode client usage](/reference/airnode/next/docker/client-image.md#usage) for
more details.

- `http://localhost:<PORT>/http-data/01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-012345678abc/<endpointId>` -
  Gateway URL for the HTTP Gateway
- `http://localhost:<PORT>/http-signed-data/01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-012345678abc/<endpointId>` -
  Gateway URL for the HTTP Signed Data Gateway

## Using CURL

In order to execute an endpoint served by either gateway, the following are
required as part of the CURL call.

- Make a POST request with the `endpointId` as a path parameter. An `endpointId`
  can found in config.json under `triggers.http.endpointId` or
  `triggers.httpSignedData.endpointId`.
- Add the `Content-Type` header, set to `application/json`.
- Place the parameters/encodedParameters in the request body.

| \* encodedParameters<div class="tSmall">HTTP Signed Data Gateway</div> | body   | `-d '{"encodedParameters": "0x3173737300....000"}'`       |

\* Parameters for the gateways are named differently. The HTTP signed data
gateway requires that the `encodedParameters` be encoded using
[Airnode ABI](/reference/airnode/next/specifications/airnode-abi.md).

### Request

Replace `<gatewayUrl>` in the examples below with the URL displayed in the
terminal at the end of an Airnode deployment using a
[Docker image](/reference/airnode/next/docker/).

::: code-group

```sh [HTTP Gateway]
curl \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"parameters": {"param1": "myValue", "param2": 5}}' \
'<gatewayUrl>/0x6db9e3e3d0...c7025f5c27af6'
```

```sh [HTTP Signed Data Gateway]
curl \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"encodedParameters": "0x3173737300....000"}' \
'<gatewayUrl>/0x6db9e3e3d0...c7025f5c27af6'
```

:::

### Response
