# {{$frontmatter.title}}

After integrating an API
([API Integration](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/api-integration.md)) and
creating the configuration files
([Configuring Airnode](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md)), the
next step is to deploy the Airnode.

## Deploy with Docker

The recommended way to deploy Airnode is by using the Docker
[deployer image](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md). This image
is simply a wrapper around the
[deployer CLI](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.13/packages/airnode-deployer).
Try the
[Deploying an Airnode on AWS](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/)
tutorial if you wish to become familiar with the deployer image first. There are
also tutorials for [GCP](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-gcp/) and a
[client Docker container](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-container/) as
well as several repo based examples in the
[Airnode monorepo example](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.13.0/packages/airnode-examples)
package.

The deployer interacts with a cloud provider to deploy Airnode programmatically,
without requiring you to click through a lot of ever-changing graphical
interfaces. For it to do so, a cloud project setup and credentials are required
and was discussed in
[Configuring an Airnode](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#aws-setup-aws-deployment-only).
There is additional guidance in the AWS and GCP quick start tutorials mentioned
above.

## Install Docker

The [deployer image](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md) is
containerized as a Docker image. This will deploy the Airnode to the cloud
provider without the worry of installing dependencies and is the recommended way
to do a deployment. If you do not already have docker installed go to the
[Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and install it.

## Deployment

At this point a project should resemble the following. The `config.json`,
`secrets.env`, `aws.env` (if deploying to AWS) and `gcp.json` (if deploying to
GCP) files should be ready to go. Other files and folders added to the project
are expected and are ignored by the deployer image.

::: code-group

```json [AWS]
my-airnode
├── aws.env
├── config.json
└── secrets.env
```

```json [GCP]
my-airnode
├── config.json
├── gcp.json
└── secrets.env
```

<WarningSimultaneousDeployments removeLink="/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.html#manual-removal"/>

From the root of the project directory run the Docker image command
[deploy](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md#deploy) as shown
below to deploy the Airnode. When the deployment has completed a `receipt.json`
file will be written to the project directory, which is mounted to the
`/app/config` directory within the container. This file contains important
configuration information about the Airnode and is needed to remove the Airnode
should the need arise.

::: code-group

```sh [Linux/Mac/WSL2]
docker run -it --rm \
  -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
  -v "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.13.0 deploy
```

```batch [Windows]
# For Windows, use CMD (not PowerShell).
docker run -it --rm ^
  -v "%cd%:/app/config" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.13.0 deploy
```

### receipt.json

The `receipt.json` file is a product of a deployment attempt. It contains
Airnode configuration and deployment information and is used to remove the
Airnode. The field `success` is important in that it specifies whether the
deployment was successful or not.

```json
{
  "airnodeWallet": {
    "airnodeAddress": "0xaBd9daAdf32fCd96eE4607bf3d5B31e19a244Cac",
    "xpub": "xpub661MyMwAqRbcGHp9uC7...vbeziJwFHuNs"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "deploymentId": "aws8fd2e911",
    "cloudProvider": {
      "type": "aws",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "disableConcurrencyReservations": false
    },
    "stage": "dev",
    "nodeVersion": "0.13.0",
    "timestamp": "2022-03-26T02:37:55.506Z"
  },
  "success": true
}
```

## Testing with HTTP Gateway

If you opted to enable the HTTP Gateway it can be used to test the Airnode while
bypassing the chain it was deployed to. There are examples that detail how to do
this.

- [HTTP Gateways](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/http-gateways.md#using-curl)
- [Deploying an Airnode on AWS](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/#_5-test-the-airnode)
- [Deploying an Airnode on GCP](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-gcp/#_6-test-the-airnode)
- [Deploying an Airnode locally using Docker](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-container/#_5-test-the-airnode)

## Make an RRP request of the Airnode

Once the Airnode is deployed, see
[Calling an Airnode](/reference/airnode/v0.13/developers/index.md) to learn how
requests are made using the request-response protocol (RRP).

## Removing the Airnode

If you would like to remove a deployed Airnode, see the Docker image commands
for [remove](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md#remove) or
[remove-with-receipt](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md#remove-with-receipt)
instructions.
