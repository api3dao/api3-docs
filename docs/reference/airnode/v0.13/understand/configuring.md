An Airnode is deployed or redeployed using configuration values from its
`config.json` and `secrets.env` files. The `config.json` specifies the
[Oracle Integration Specifications OIS](/reference/ois/2.2/specification.md) and
other specific configuration details. The `secrets.env` file holds secrets, such
as API keys and chain provider URLs, which are referenced within the config.json
file using interpolation.

- [secrets.env](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/examples/secrets-env.md)
- [aws.env](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/examples/aws-env.md)

## Creating `config.json`

Use the
[config.json template](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/templates/config-json.md)
to build your own Airnode configuration file or alter the
[config.json example](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/examples/config-json.md)
file. There are six root level fields in `config.json`.

- [chains](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#chains)
- [nodeSettings](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#nodesettings)
- [triggers](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#triggers)
- [templates](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#templates)
- [ois](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#ois)
- [apiCredentials](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#apicredentials)

### chains

Each row in the `chains` array represents an Ethereum blockchain the Airnode
will serve as identified by the `id`. Currently Airnode only supports Ethereum
blockchains as denoted by `type: "evm"`. There are several supported
blockchains, see them in the
[Airnode contract addresses](/reference/airnode/v0.13/) doc. You can use
multiple chain providers for each chain and declare multiple chains each with
one of more chain providers. See
[Chains Providers](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/chain-providers.md) in
_Concepts and Definitions_.

Below is a simple chain array with a single chain provider.

```json
"chains": [
  {
    "authorizers": {
      "requesterEndpointAuthorizers": [
        "0xf18c105D0375E80980e4EED829a4A68A539E6178"
      ],

        "url": "${INFURA_SEPOLIA_PROVIDER_URL}"
      }
    },
    "type": "evm",
    "options": {
      "gasPriceOracle": [
        {
          "gasPriceStrategy": "latestBlockPercentileGasPrice",
          "percentile": 60,
          "minTransactionCount": 20,

          "recommendedGasPriceMultiplier": 1.2,
        },
        {
          "gasPriceStrategy": "providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice",
          "baseFeeMultiplier": 2,
          "priorityFee": {
            "value": 3.12,
            "unit": "gwei",
          }
        },
        {
          "gasPriceStrategy": "constantGasPrice",
          "gasPrice": {
            "value": 10,
            "unit": "gwei"
          }
        }
      ],
    },
    "maxConcurrency": 100,
    "blockHistoryLimit": 300,
    "minConfirmations": 0
  }
],
```

::: info Idiosyncrasies

See the dedicated
[<span style="color: rgb(16, 185, 129)">Chain Idiosyncrasies</span>](/reference/airnode/v0.13/chain-idiosyncrasies.md)
page for chain-specific configuration considerations.

:::

#### Considerations: Gas Price Oracle

The gas price oracle strategies are applied in the order that they are listed.
Airnode supports four strategies: `latestBlockPercentileGasPrice`,
`providerRecommendedGasPrice`, `providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice` and
`constantGasPrice`. The only required strategy is `constantGasPrice` and it is
recommended to place it as the last strategy in the list as it should be the
final fallback for the Airnode to use if all other strategies fail. For more
detail on these strategies, see the
[Gas Price Strategies](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/gas-prices.md) page.

#### Considerations: Concurrency

If you set the `maxConcurrency` field to value X, then Airnode will guarantee
that:

- At most X api calls are made to the API
- At most X transactions (made by blockchain providers) will be made by the
  blockchain providers of the respective chain

When doing this, Airnode will calculate the total number of requests reported by
all blockchain providers. If this number exceeds the maximum concurrency limit,
Airnode will start processing the oldest request from the blockchain providers
until the number of processed requests reaches the limit. All other requests are
dropped and will be processed in the next Airnode run.

Note that this request dropping happens for each **chain** separately.

For example, if `maxConcurrency` is set to 5 and there are three providers (A, B
and C) and they reported the following requests:

- A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5
- B1, B2 and B3
- C1 and C2

The above example results in the following requests: A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1.

::: warning

Note, that this limit only applies to the requests initiated on chain. For
example, requests initiated using HTTP gateway are not included in this limit.
Also note that, this limit is configured per chain and the limits of different
chains are unrelated to each other.

- [minConfirmations](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#minconfirmations)

### nodeSettings

The `nodeSettings` field holds node-specific (Airnode) configuration parameters.

```json
{
"nodeSettings": {
    "cloudProvider": {
      "type": "aws",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "disableConcurrencyReservations": false
    },
    "airnodeWalletMnemonic": "${AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC}",
    "heartbeat": {
      "enabled": true,
      "apiKey": "${HEARTBEAT_API_KEY}",
      "url": "${HEARTBEAT_URL}"
    },
    "httpGateway": {
      "enabled": true,
      "maxConcurrency": 20,
      "corsOrigins": []
    },
    "httpSignedDataGateway": {
      "enabled": true,
      "maxConcurrency": 20,
      "corsOrigins": []
    },
    "logFormat": "plain",
    "logLevel": "INFO",
    "nodeVersion": "0.13.0",
    "stage": "dev"
  },
```

#### Considerations: Cloud Providers

Currently, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are
supported cloud providers for hosting Airnode. Note that while many fields
within `nodeSettings` are required by both, there are some cloud provider
specific fields. For example, `cloudProvider.projectId` is only required with
GCP. Also note that not all cloud provider regions can be deployed to; see the
[cloudProvider.region reference](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#cloudprovider-region)
for more information.

#### Considerations: Gateways

Airnode offers two gateways for accessing provider HTTP endpoints without using
the blockchain: `httpGateway` and `httpSignedDataGateway`. For more information
on each of these see the
[HTTP Gateways](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/http-gateways.md)
documentation. Also note that that distinct API keys must be used for each.

### triggers

The `triggers` field allow exposes Airnode endpoints from an OIS selectively for
the RRP protocol or via the HTTP gateway. For example, an OIS object may include
10 endpoints, but only two are desired for RRP and all 10 for the gateway.

List the endpoints to serve with the request–response protocol (RRP) under
`triggers.rrp`. List the endpoints to serve with the HTTP gateway under
`triggers.http`. List the endpoints which can be used to get the signed data in
`triggers.httpSignedData`. In most cases create a trigger for each endpoint in
your OIS object.

```json
"triggers": {
    "rrp": [
      {
        "endpointId": "0xd4b0718c9a3316dbd831e6d01058202e5dde20a116304419f0d79e07a82b46bf",
        "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Requests",
        "endpointName": "coinGeckoMarketData",
        "cacheResponses": false
      }
    ],
    "http": [
      {
        "endpointId": "0xd4b0718c9a3316dbd831e6d01058202e5dde20a116304419f0d79e07a82b46bf",
        "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Requests",
        "endpointName": "coinGeckoMarketData"
      }
    ],
    "httpSignedData": [
      {
        "endpointId": "0xd4b0718c9a3316dbd831e6d01058202e5dde20a116304419f0d79e07a82b46bf",
        "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Requests",
        "endpointName": "coinGeckoMarketData"
      }
    ]
  },
```

#### Considerations: triggers

The `endpointId` required for `rrp`, `http`, and `httpSignedData` can be derived
from the `oisTitle` and `endpointName` using the CLI command
[derive-endpoint-id](/reference/airnode/v0.13/packages/admin-cli.md#derive-endpoint-id).
Remember that an Airnode's config.json file can have more than one OIS object
and that these endpoints can be triggers for `rrp`, `http`, and/or
`httpSignedData` as desired.

#### Considerations: cached responses

When setting `triggers.rrp[n].cacheResponses` to `true`, Airnode caches API
responses on the local filesystem per request ID. This only applies to
blockchain requests. The flow is:

1. A request is received from the Blockchain.
1. The Airnode does an HTTP/S call to a remote API based on the request.
1. [with caching enabled] Airnode stores the response on the local filesystem by
   request ID.
1. Airnode then follows the usual process of extracting the response,
   post-processing it and sending the response back on chain as a fulfillment
   callback.
1. After all current requests are processed, Airnode then exits until the next
   cycle (the next minute).
1. If during the next cycle, if the Airnode gets the same request and it isn't
   fulfilled, it will try and fulfill the request again. Ordinarily, without
   caching enabled, it would follow steps 1, 2 and 4 (as shown above), but with
   caching enabled it will fulfill the response using the cached API response
   value.

Clearance of the local filesystem cache is dependant on the environment Airnode
runs in. As a guideline:

- AWS Lambda persists for 2.5 hours.
- Google Cloud persistence is completely arbitrary.
- Docker persists as long as the container remains running.

If the local filesystem is cleared, the cache is lost and if a repeat request is
received after the cache has been cleared, Airnode will repeat the API call.
Airnode self-clears cached data after the data has reached 1 hour's age.

Furthermore, as an example: "if an Airnode AWS Lambda environment/container"
(since this example of 2.5 hrs is specific to AWS) has been "warm" for 2.4 hours
and Airnode gets a request, that request will only be cached until the container
resets, in this case 2.5 hours - 2.4 hours = 0.1 hours.

As described above, caching on serverless infrastructure is unreliable and if
request caching is mission critical, Airnode should be run in a Docker container
with a persistent `/tmp` directory.

Caching is useful for non-idempotent API operations like random number
generators. Consider the following use-case:

> Random Numbers: in the absence of caching, a malicious blockchain provider can
> selectively block fulfillments containing numbers they don't like, allowing
> them to improve their odds of winning in a random-number betting game.

  - [httpSignedData[n].endpointName](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#httpsigneddata-n-endpointname)

### templates

The templates field allows you to specify templates to be used to make template
requests. The array can be left empty if no templates will be used.

#### References: templates

The links below offer additional details for each field from the Deployment
Files section:

- [templateId](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#templateid)
- [endpointId](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#endpointid)
- [encodedParameters](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#encodedparameters)

### ois

The `ois` field is a list OIS objects that Airnode will be serving. This means
that a single instance of an Airnode can serve multiple APIs. You can simply
copy paste OIS objects that you will be serving into the `ois` list. Use the
previous guide
[API Integration](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/api-integration.md) to
create an OIS object. The full specification is available in the
[Oracle Integration Specifications (OIS)](/reference/ois/2.2/) documentation.

### apiCredentials

Each entry in `apiCredentials` maps to a security scheme defined in an OIS
(`ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}` and
`ois[n].security`), where `oisTitle` is the `title` field of the related OIS,
and `securitySchemeName` is the name of the respective security scheme. These
would be `myOisTitle` and `mySecurityScheme` in the example below.
`securitySchemeValue` is the value used for the authentication with the security
scheme (e.g., the API key).

If no security scheme is needed, leave the `apiCredentials` array empty.

```json
// apiCredentials
[
  {
    "oisTitle": "myOisTitle",
    "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
    "securitySchemeValue": "${SS_MY_API_KEY}"
  }
]

// From the OIS object apiCredentials is referencing
// using the oisTitle/securitySchemeName pair.
{
  "title": "myOisTitle",
  ...,
  "components": {
    "securitySchemes": {
      "mySecurityScheme": {
        "in": "header",
        "type": "apiKey",
        "name": "X-api-key"
      }
    }
  },
  "security":{
    "mySecurityScheme": []
  }
  ...
}
```

#### Considerations: apiCredentials

Currently Airnode supports the following security scheme types when making API
calls: `apiKey` and `http`. For more detail, visit the previous section on
[API Security](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/api-security.md).

#### References: `apiCredentials`

The links below offer additional details for each field from the Deployment
Files section:

- [oisTitle](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#oistitle)
- [securitySchemeName](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#securityschemename)
- [securitySchemeValue](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#securityschemevalue)

## Creating `secrets.env`

The `secrets.env` file contains values (secrets) such as blockchain provider
urls, chain provider urls, etc. These secrets are embedded in
[config.json](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md) using
interpolation.

```json
// Sample interpolation value from config.json
"heartbeat": {
  "enabled": true,
  "apiKey": "${HEARTBEAT_API_KEY}"
},

// Sample variable in secrets.env
// Variable names cannot contain dashes (-) or start with a number.
HEARTBEAT_API_KEY="d714a900-3b9e-4e4d-8eae-756ef06a8836"
```

Use the
[secrets.env](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/templates/secrets-env.md)
template and refer to
[Reference > Deployment Files > secrets.env](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/secrets-env.md)
as needed.

## AWS setup (AWS deployment only)

When it is time to deploy the Airnode to AWS, the Docker
[deployer image](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md) will need
the AWS credentials to build the node on AWS Lambda.

### Creating `aws.env` (AWS only)

Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA) if needed. It
explains how to create an IAM user and get security credentials. Put them in the
`aws.env` file as shown below. See an
[example file](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/templates/aws-env.md)
in the reference section.

- Variable names cannot contain dashes (-) or start with a number.

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XYZ...123
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ABC7...89
```

## GCP setup (GCP deployment only)

When it is time to deploy the Airnode to GCP, the Docker
[deployer image](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md) will need
the GCP project ID to build the Airnode.

### Creating a GCP project

First
[create a GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
under which will the Airnode be deployed. Once the project is created, insert
its
[projectId](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#cloudprovider)
into the `config.json` file.

### Enable required API

In order for Airnode to deploy successfully, enable
[App Engine Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/appengine.googleapis.com)
for the GCP project. After enabling it, wait a few minutes before the deployment
itself so the change will take place.

### Creating a Service Account

Create a new service account from the
[Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
menu. Grant this service account access to the project by adding a role `Owner`
during the creation process.

Once the account is created, add a new access key of type JSON for this account.
Download the key file as `gcp.json` into the root of your project.

## Summary

In this guide you created the `config.json`, `secrets.env` and obtained cloud
provider credentials required to deploy an Airnode to a cloud provider. Note
that `config.json` is user-specific and therefore it is not much use to others.

The `secrets.env`, `aws.env` and `gcp.json` files contains keys, chain provider
urls and security credentials, so they should be kept secret. Make sure that you
do not push your credentials to a repository or otherwise expose them as these
credentials can be used to gain access to your Airnode's private key, AWS
account or GCP account.
