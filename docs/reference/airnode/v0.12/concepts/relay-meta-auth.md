# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Using the relayed meta data security schemes does not require
blockchain-specific knowledge or blockchain interaction by an API provider and
there are no blockchain transaction (gas) fees. Just apply the desired security
scheme fields in the Airnode `config.json` file during deployment of an Airnode,
see [Building an Airno/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/). Then have your API
operations check for any security scheme values you configured (typically the
`sponsorAddress`) against your customer database.

## Simple Example

The illustration below is one way to make use of relayed meta data for security
purposes. Here a sponsor (a.k.a. developer or customer) submits their
`sponsorAddress` to be stored by an API provider. The `sponsorAddress` can be
used to authenticate requests by a sponsor's smart contracts.

The following sections relate to the numbers shown in the diagram above.

### 1: Deploy Airnode

An Airnode is deployed with the `sponsorAddress` security scheme instructing
Airnode to pass along the `sponsorAddress` with all requests.

### 2: Register Sponsors

A sponsor is the developer of an on-chain smart contract that wishes to request
off-chain data from an API provider. A sponsor has a know `sponsorAddress`. The
API provider can request the `sponsorAddress` from the sponsor using a webform
as part of a paid subscription setup.

### 3: Making Requests

When a smart contract (requester) makes a request of any API operation, the
`sponsorAddress` will be part of the request. A sponsor can have more than one
requester.

- 3a: The requester makes a request to Airnode.
- 3b: Airnode adds the `sponsorAddress` to the request before passing the
  request to the API operation. The API operation performs a lookup on the
  `sponsorAddress` to verify it has a subscription. If verified the API
  operation returns the response to Airnode.
- 3c: Airnode returns the response to the requester.

## Security Schemes

Including the `sponsorAddress` used in the
[Simple Example](/reference/airnode/v0.12/concepts/relay-meta-auth.md#simple-example)
above, there are five _relayed meta data security schemes_ that can be
incorporated into any Airnode.

- [relayChainId](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relaychainid) -
  The chain ID the request came from.
- [relayChainType](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relaychaintype) -
  The chain type the request came from.
- [relaySponsorAddress](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relaysponsoraddress) -
  The sponsor's wallet address. The sponsor owns and operates one or more
  requesters.
- [relaySponsorWalletAddress](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relaysponsorwalletaddress) -
  Other wallet addresses associated with each requester. These are owned and
  funded by a sponsor to pay on-chain gas costs.
- [relayRequesterAddress](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relayrequesteraddress) -
  The on-chain address of the requester (smart contract).
- [relayRequestId](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relayrequestid) -
  The id of the request.
