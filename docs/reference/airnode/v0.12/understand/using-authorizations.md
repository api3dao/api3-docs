# {{$frontmatter.title}}

An Airnode can authorize smart contracts (know as requesters) access to its
endpoints using
[Authorizations](/reference/airnode/v0.12/concepts/authorizations.md). This
method is off-chain and requires no blockchain knowledge by an API provider. It
is different than
[Authorizers](/reference/airnode/v0.12/concepts/authorizers.md) which is an
on-chain auth scheme.

::: info Alternative: Relayed Meta Data

As an alternative to authorizers and authorizations, an API provider can use
[<span style="color: rgb(16, 185, 129)">Relayed Meta Data</span>](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/api-security.md#relayed-meta-data-security-schemes)
to authenticate a request. This approach is off-chain and requires no blockchain
knowledge by the API provider. Note that it is possible to use authorizers,
authorizations, and relayed meta data together.

:::

Authorizations use scheme types that hard-code access to an Airnode's endpoints
in the same file that defines the Airnode, its `config.json` file. These
hard-coded values are endpointId/address pairs that the Airnode will use to
allow access to its endpoints by requesters (smart contracts).

Nothing in _authorizers_ can supersede permissions granted by _authorizations_
as the latter takes precedence.  
Currently there is only one _authorizations_ scheme type,
`requesterEndpointAuthorizations`.

## requesterEndpointAuthorizations

Currently `requesterEndpointAuthorizations` is the only scheme type available
for _authorizations_. It defines a list of endpointIds each with a array of
requester addresses that can access them.

```json
{
 ...
 "chains":[
    {
        "id": "1",
        ...
        "authorizers": {
            "requesterEndpointAuthorizers": []
                             The scheme type requesterEndpointAuthorizations
        },                   grants access to endpointId/address pairs
        "authorizations": {  ⬇
            "requesterEndpointAuthorizations": {
                "0x6db9...7af6": ["0xdhrt...A498"],
                "0x8dd9...5ad7": ["0xdhrt...A498", "0xcse0...D236"],
                       ⬆                 ⬆                ⬆
                       endpointId         requester addresses
            }
        },
    },
 ]
}
```
