# {{$frontmatter.title}}

The following guide assumes a valid v0.11.2 `config.json` file. All changes
listed below will need to be implemented in order to migrate to Airnode v0.12.0.
This document is written in a way that will preserve existing behavior with
earlier Airnode versions.

The document also mentions changes to user facing services related to Airnode,
such as airnode-deployer, airnode-admin, etc., and new features.

## Summary

1. `ois[n].oisFormat` updated to "2.1.0". This has not changed since v0.11.2,
   but has changed since v0.11.0 and v0.11.1 for which it was "2.0.0".

2. `nodeSettings.nodeVersion` updated to "0.12.0".

## Details

1. `ois[n].oisFormat`

Updated to "2.1.0". This has not changed since v0.11.2, but has changed since
v0.11.0 and v0.11.1 for which it was "2.0.0".

```diff
{
- "oisFormat": "2.0.0"
+ "oisFormat": "2.1.0"
}
```

2. `nodeSettings.nodeVersion`

Updated to "0.12.0"

```diff
{
- "nodeVersion": "0.11.2"
+ "nodeVersion": "0.12.0"
}
```

## New features and updates

- There is no longer a hardcoded limit to the maximum number of sponsor wallet
  requests processed each cycle.

- Data from the HTTP Gateway is returned from successful API calls that fail
  response processing in order to assist with debugging. For an example, see the
  [HTTP Gateways](/reference/airnode/v0.12/understand/http-gateways.md#http-gateway)
  page.

- In all pre-processing and post-processing steps, parameters are now immutably
  exposed via an `endpointParameters` object and reserved parameters are no
  longer accessible.

- The `value` for a `fixedOperationParameters` object is now allowed to be any
  type, including an object; for example, the following specifies an array
  containing multiple primitives. This has not changed since v0.11.2, but has
  changed since v0.11.0 and v0.11.1 for which it was only allowed to be a
  string.

  ```json
  {
    "fixedOperationParameters": [
      {
        "operationParameter": {
          "in": "query",
          "name": "params"
        },
        "value": ["finalized", false]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- A new gas strategy, `sanitizedProviderRecommendedGasPrice`, has been added.
  See the
  [gas price documentation](/reference/airnode/v0.12/concepts/gas-prices.md#sanitizedproviderrecommendedgasprice)
  for more details.

- Gas can now be automatically estimated for RRP fulfillments on supported
  chains by excluding `chains[n].options.fulfillmentGasLimit` from
  `config.json`. For more details see the
  [corresponding documentation](/reference/airnode/v0.12/deployment-files/config-json.md#options-fulfillmentgaslimit).

- `AirnodeRrpV0` and `RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721` contract addresses are now
  optional if there is an API3 deployment for that contract on the specified
  chain. A table of such deployments can be found on the
  [Contract Addresses](/reference/airnode/v0.12/index.md) page. The following
  illustrates how the addresses can be omitted. First, within the `chains[n]`
  object:

  ```diff
  {
  - "contracts": {
  -   "AirnodeRrp": "0x..."
  - },
  }
  ```

  And second, within the `chains[n].authorizers` object:

  ```diff
  {
    "authorizers": {
      "requesterEndpointAuthorizers": [],
      "crossChainRequesterAuthorizers": [
        {
          "requesterEndpointAuthorizers": ["0x..."],
          "chainType": "evm",
          "chainId": "5",
  -       "contracts": {
  -         "AirnodeRrp": "0x..."
  -       },
          "chainProvider": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.2"
          }
        }
      ],
      "requesterAuthorizersWithErc721": [
        {
  -       "RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721": "0x...",
          "erc721s": ["0x..."]
        }
      ],
      "crossChainRequesterAuthorizersWithErc721": [
        {
          "erc721s": ["0x..."],
          "chainType": "evm",
          "chainId": "5",
  -       "contracts": {
  -         "RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721": "0x..."
  -       },
          "chainProvider": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.2"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
