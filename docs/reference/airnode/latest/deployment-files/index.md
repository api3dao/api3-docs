Airnode is deployed with the following files:

- [config.json](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/config-json.md):
  specifies the API–Airnode integrations and various node and deployment
  parameters.

- [secrets.env](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/secrets-env.md):
  holds secrets used by Airnode such as the Airnode mnemonic, API keys,
  blockchain provider URLs, and more.

- [aws.env](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/aws-env.md): (AWS
  deployments only) holds AWS credentials and is required by the Docker
  [deployer image](/reference/airnode/latest/docker/deployer-image.md).

- gcp.json: (GCP deployments only) holds GCP project information and is required
  by the Docker
  [deployer image](/reference/airnode/latest/docker/deployer-image.md). This
  file is downloaded from a GCP project. See the guide
  [Deploying an Airnode on GCP](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-gcp/#_3-gcp-project-setup-credentials)
  for more information.

Airnode deployments utilize secrets such as security scheme values (i.e., API
keys) and blockchain provider URLs. These secrets are injected into
`config.json` from `secrets.env` using standard shell variable interpolation
syntax (e.g. `${VARIABLE}`). This way secrets are stored separately but are
available as part of the configuration during the Airnode runtime.

The `config.json` file does NOT reference values in `aws.env` as `aws.env` is
read directly by the deployer image.

The deployer image outputs a
[receipt.json](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/receipt-json.md) file
after deployment, which contains information about the deployment that can be
referred to later on for interaction or removal.
