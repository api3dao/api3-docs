# {{$frontmatter.title}}

This document describes changes to `config.json` as well as to user facing
services related to Airnode, such as airnode-deployer, airnode-admin, etc.

## Changes to `config.json`

The following assumes a valid v0.13 `config.json` file. All changes listed below
must be implemented in order to migrate to Airnode v0.14.0.

1. `nodeSettings.nodeVersion`

Updated to "0.14.0"

```diff
{
- "nodeVersion": "0.13.0"
+ "nodeVersion": "0.14.0"
}
```

2. `ois[n].oisFormat`

Updated to "2.3.1".

```diff
{
- "oisFormat": "2.2.1"
+ "oisFormat": "2.3.1"
}
```

## Breaking changes outside of `config.json`

The following are not expected to have an impact on users, but are listed here
for completeness.

- The OEV interface has changed in the following ways:
  - `api3ServerV1` has replaced `dapiServerAddress`
  - `templateId` has replaced `endpointId` and `encodedParameters`
- `chainNames` and `networks` are no longer exported from `references.json` of
  `airnode-protocol`.
- Support for `boba-avalanche` has been removed as the chain has shut down.

## New features and fixes

- In conjunction with OIS v2.3.1, there is now a version 2 of pre-processing and
  post-processing. More details can be found in the
  [OIS reference](/reference/ois/latest/processing.md#v2).
- OEV gateway AWS lambda memory has been increased from 256 MB to 2048 MB
- Airnode protocol contracts have been deployed on LightLink, LightLink Goerli
  Testnet, and Blast Sepolia Testnet chains. You can find the addresses on the
  [Contracts page](/reference/airnode/next/index.md).
