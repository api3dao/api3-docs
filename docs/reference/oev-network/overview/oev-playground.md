The easiest way to experience OEV extraction and the OEV Network is through the
[OEV Playground](https://api3dao.github.io/oev-playground/). OEV Playground will
walk you through the entire searcher flow by providing a graphical interface to
perform each step.

The playground consists of the following:

- How to bridge ETH to the OEV network.
- How to deposit collateral in the OevAuctionHouse contract.
- How to place a bid on the OEV network.
- How to execute the update once awarded.
- How to report an update once the update is executed.

The nitty gritty details that are happening with each steps are discussed in
detail in the playground.
