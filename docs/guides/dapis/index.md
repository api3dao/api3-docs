# {{$frontmatter.title}}

This is the getting started section for dAPIs along with some frequently asked
questions. If you have a question that is not answered here, you can head over
to our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/qnRrcfnm5W).

## What are dAPIs?

dAPIs are on-chain decentralized data feeds sourced directly from
[first-party oracles](/explore/airnode/why-first-party-oracles.md) owned and
operated by API providers themselves (using
[Airnode](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/)) and are continuously updated
using [signed data](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md). dApp
owners can read the on-chain value of any dAPI in real-time.

dAPIs serve a variety of data feeds, such as latest cryptocurrency, stock, and
commodity prices. They can power various decentralized applications such as DeFi
lending, synthetic assets, stable coins, derivatives, NFTs, and more.

## What is the API3 Market?

[API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/) enables users to browse, activate and
manage dAPIs. Within the Market you can see all live dAPIs on the supported
chains. You can also see the details of each dAPI, such as the provider, the
asset type, the deviation threshold, the heartbeat, and the last on-chain
updated price.

Check out the API3 Market [here](https://market.api3.org/). You can browse
through the available dAPIs and check out their details.

## What are Managed dAPIs?

[Managed dAPIs](/reference/dapis/understand/managed.md) are sourced directly
from multiple [first-party](/explore/airnode/why-first-party-oracles.md) data
providers running an Airnode and aggregated using their
[Airnode's signed data](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md).
Unlike self-funded dAPIs, API3 manages the gas costs and the availability of the
Managed dAPIs.

With Managed dAPIs, users get the option to configure the
[deviation threshold](/reference/dapis/understand/deviations.md) and
[heartbeat](/reference/dapis/understand/deviations.md#heartbeat) for each dAPI.
The deviation threshold is the percentage deviation from the current value of
the dAPI that triggers an update. If a dAPI is not updated within a known amount
of time (called the heartbeat), the dAPI update is triggered.

[Click here](/guides/dapis/subscribing-managed-dapis/) to read more about how to
get started with Managed dAPIs.

## What are Self-funded dAPIs?

[Self-funded dAPIs](/reference/dapis/understand/self-funded.md) are sourced
directly from a single
[first-party](/explore/airnode/why-first-party-oracles.md) data provider running
an Airnode. The amount of gas you supply will determine how long your dAPI will
be available for use. If you run out of gas, you can fund the dAPI again to keep
it available for use. Unlike managed dAPIs, API3 does not manage the gas costs
and the availability of the Self-funded dAPIs.

Self-funded dAPIs are only available at 1% deviation threshold and 24-hour
heartbeat by default. You can update the deviation threshold and heartbeat by
placing an order for a Managed dAPI.

[Click here](/guides/dapis/subscribing-self-funded-dapis/) to read more about
how to get started with Self-funded dAPIs.

## How to use dAPIs in a smart contract?

To read a dAPI value in a smart contract, import the `IProxy.sol` interface and
call the `read()` function. Here's an example:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.5/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@api3/contracts/v0.8/interfaces/IProxy.sol";

contract DataFeedReaderExample is Ownable {
    // The proxy contract address obtained from the API3 Market UI.
    address public proxyAddress;

    // Updating the proxy contract address is a security-critical
    // action. In this example, only the owner is allowed to do so.
    function setProxyAddress(address _proxyAddress) public onlyOwner {
        proxyAddress = _proxyAddress;
    }

    function readDataFeed()
        external
        view
        returns (int224 value, uint256 timestamp)
    {
        // Use the IProxy interface to read a dAPI via its
        // proxy contract .
        (value, timestamp) = IProxy(proxyAddress).read();
        // If you have any assumptions about `value` and `timestamp`,
        // make sure to validate them after reading from the proxy.
    }
}
```

You'll have to set the `proxyAddress` using the `setProxyAddress()` function.
You can get the `proxyAddress` for activated dAPIs from within the data feed
dashboard through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/).

## Data providers for managed dAPIs

There are nine providers used by managed dAPIs as a data source. These providers
can be grouped by asset type(s) of supplied data:

- Coinpaprika
- dxFeed
- Finage
- Finnhub
- IEXCloud
- Kaiko
- NCFX
- Tradermade
- Twelvedata

| Asset Type     | Data Providers                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cryptocurrency | Coinpaprika, Finage, Twelvedata, NCFX, Kaiko, dxFeed            |
| Forex          | Finage, Twelvedata, NCFX, IEXCloud, Finnhub, dxFeed, Tradermade |
| Commodities    | Finage, Twelvedata, dxFeed, Tradermade                          |
| Equities       | Finage, Twelvedata, IEXCloud, Finnhub, dxFeed                   |

### Self-funded dAPIs

Self-funded dAPIs are single-sourced using [Nodary](https://nodary.io/) as their
data provider.

## What are dAPI Proxy Contracts?

Each dAPI has a proxy contract that is used to read the value of the dAPI. The
proxy contract is linked to a mapping that maps to a `beaconId` or
`beaconSetId`. The `beaconId` for each dAPI gets updated when the price hits the
set
[deviation threshold](/reference/dapis/understand/deviations.md)/[heartbeat](/reference/dapis/understand/deviations.md#heartbeat)
using
[Airnode's Signed Data](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md).
