# {{$frontmatter.title}}

This guide demonstrates local deployment of an Airnode followed by an off-chain
[HTTP Gateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md) request.
Configuration files are provided with only minor changes to be made. The
[latest release](https://hub.docker.com/r/api3/airnode-client/tags) of the
Airnode [client image](/reference/airnode/latest/docker/client-image.md) will be
used to deploy the off-chain component of Airnode (a.k.a., the node) to a Docker
container, in this case a locally run Docker container.

This Airnode contains a single API operation (`GET /simple/price`) from
[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) which returns the
current value of a coin. This guide does not detail the overall configuration of
an Airnode, it is just a quick start guide then lends itself to understanding an
Airnode deployment.

Please note that this tutorial does not involve the blockchain nor an RRP
(request-response protocol) call from a smart contract. If you wish to make an
RRP call, please see the guides
[Making an RRP Request](/guides/airnode/rrp-request.md) and
[Calling an Airnode](/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/).

## Configuration Files

An Airnode Docker container deployment uses a Docker image (called
[client image](/reference/airnode/latest/docker/client-image.md)) which requires
two files as input:
[config.json](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-container/index.md#config-json)
and
[secrets.env](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-container/index.md#secrets-env).
These files have been created and only require a few minor changes on your part
to make the deployment of the demo Airnode successful. The changes are needed to
supply a chain provider url and a mnemonic.

## 1. Install Prerequisites

Install the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and launch it.

## 2. Project Folder

Download the <a href="/zip-files/quick-start-container.zip" download>
quick-start-container.zip</a> project folder. Extract it into any location.

```
quick-start-container
├── config.json
└── secrets.env
```

## 3. Prepare Configuration Files

Prepare the two configuration files `config.json` and `secrets.env`. By default,
the Airnode client image looks for them in the project root directory.

### config.json

::: details config.json

```json
<!--@include: ./src/config.json-->
```

:::

This file requires no changes on your part. It has been created with just one
API endpoint and configured to listen to requests on the Sepolia test network,
though this tutorial will not make any such requests. There are a few variables
this file will interpolate from `secrets.env`.

### secrets.env

::: details secrets.env

```sh
<!--@include: ./src/secrets.env-->
```

:::

There are two values `config.json` interpolates from `secrets.env`. Add values
for each of these fields.

- `CHAIN_PROVIDER_URL`: A blockchain provider url (including its API key) from a
  provider such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/). Use a url for the Sepolia
  test network. If you need help creating one see the guide
  [Create an Infura key](/guides/misc/infura-key/).

- `AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC`: Provide the seed phrase (mnemonic) to a new digital
  wallet. The wallet does not need to be funded. Use the Admin CLI command
  [generate-airnode-mnemonic](/reference/airnode/latest/packages/admin-cli.md#generate-airnode-mnemonic)
  to create one.

  ```sh [generate-airnode-mnemonic]
  npx @api3/airnode-admin generate-airnode-mnemonic
  ```

## 4. Deploy

If your Docker Desktop application already has an image named
`api3/airnode-client:latest` remove it first. The version behind `latest` may
have changed since it was last used.

For the Docker command below, note that `--publish HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`
parameter (Mac/WSL2/PowerShell) can have different values for the `HOST_PORT`
and `CONTAINER_PORT`, e.g. `--publish 8000:3000` would expose the web server on
port 8000 on the host machine.

For Linux, it's recommended to use
[host networking](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/). When using host
networking, change the port via
[gatewayServerPort](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/config-json.md#cloudprovider-gatewayserverport)
property inside config.json.

Run the following command to deploy the Airnode locally from the root of the
quick-deploy-container folder.

::: code-group

```sh [Mac/WSL2/PowerShell]
docker run \
  --volume "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  --name quick-start-container-airnode \
  --publish 3000:3000 \
  api3/airnode-client:latest
```

```batch [Windows CMD]
docker run ^
  --volume "%cd%:/app/config" ^
  --name quick-start-container-airnode ^
  --publish 3000:3000 ^
  api3/airnode-client:latest
```

```sh [Linux (host networking)]
docker run \
  --volume "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  --name quick-start-container-airnode \
  --network host \
  api3/airnode-client:latest
```

:::

In the console output, or equivalently in the `quick-deploy-container-airnode`
Docker desktop container logs, make note of the `HTTP gateway URL` as shown
below. It will be different and you will need it to test the Airnode.

```sh [output]
# The following line should appear within the first ten lines of the output
INFO HTTP (testing) gateway listening for request on "http://localhost:3000/http-data/k897...38x9fi/:endpointId"
```

## 5. Test the Airnode

After a successful deployment the Airnode can be tested directly using its
off-chain [HTTP Gateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md).
As a reminder, this is independent of the blockchain and RRP contract.

### HTTP Gateway

Looking at the `config.json` code snippet below shows that the HTTP gateway is
configured for the Airnode. Furthermore, the endpoint for `/simple/price` (with
an `endpointId` of `0x6...af6`) is present in `triggers.http[n]`. Only those
endpoints added to the `http` array can be tested using the HTTP gateway.

::: details Expand to view: HTTP gateway and endpoint ID

```json
"nodeSettings": {
  ...
  "httpGateway": {
    "enabled": true, // The gateway is activated for this Airnode
    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  ...
},
"triggers": {
  "rrp": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
      "cacheResponses": false
    }
  ],
  "http": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

:::

### Execute Endpoint

Use CURL to execute a HTTP gateway request for the CoinGecko endpoint
`/simple/price`.

As an alternative to CURL, an app such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/) can be used. Windows
users can also use
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
(WSL2) to run CURL on Linux.

In order to test an endpoint, make a HTTP POST request with the `Content-Type`
header set to `application/json`, the endpoint parameters in the request body,
and the `endpointId` as a path parameter.

- `-X`: POST
- `-H`: The `Content-Type` using the value of `application/json`.
- `-d`: Use request body data to pass the endpoint parameter key/value pair.
- `url`:
  - `<httpGatewayUrl>`: The HTTP gateway URL as displayed in the terminal at the
    end of an Airnode deployment, less the `:endpointId` placeholder.
  - <code style="overflow-wrap:break-word;">0x6db9...c27af6</code>: Passed as a
    path parameter, the `endpointId` to call. The value originates from
    `triggers.rrp[0].endpointId` in the `config.json` file.

```sh
# For Windows CMD replace line termination marker \ with ^
curl -X POST \
  -d '{"parameters":{"coinIds":"api3","coinVs_currencies":"usd"}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  '<httpGatewayUrl>/0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "rawValue": { "api3": { "usd": 1.18 } },
  "encodedValue": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000120160",
  "values": ["1180000"]
}
```

## 6. Start and Stop

You can start and stop the Airnode with the Docker desktop application or via
terminal commands.

```sh
docker stop quick-start-container-airnode

docker start quick-start-container-airnode
```

## 7. Logs

You can view the Airnode's logs with the Docker desktop application or via
terminal commands.

```sh
docker logs quick-start-container-airnode

docker logs --follow quick-start-container-airnode
```

## 8. Remove the Airnode

When you are done with the demo Airnode you can remove it by using the Docker
desktop application or by using the following terminal command. When using the
terminal command be sure to stop the container first if running.

```sh
# Stop the container if it is running.
docker stop quick-start-container-airnode

docker rm quick-start-container-airnode
```

## Summary

You have deployed a local Airnode using the Docker client image and tested an
API integration using the Airnode's off-chain
[HTTP gateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md).

To do so, you made a CURL request (using HTTP) to the HTTP gateway, following
which Airnode queried the API provider and returned a response. All of this was
performed without accessing the blockchain.

This guide did not address making an on-chain request as its purpose was to
quickly deploy a functional Airnode. See the guides
[Making an RRP Request](/guides/airnode/rrp-request.md) and
[Calling an Airnode](/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/) to learn how your
smart contract can make an RRP call to an Airnode.
