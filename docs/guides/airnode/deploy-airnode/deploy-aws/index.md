# {{$frontmatter.title}}

This guide demonstrates the deployment of an Airnode followed by an off-chain
[HTTP Gateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md) request.
Configuration files are provided with only minor changes to be made. The
[latest release](https://hub.docker.com/r/api3/airnode-deployer/tags) of the
Airnode [deployer image](/reference/airnode/latest/docker/deployer-image.md)
will be used to deploy the off-chain component of Airnode (a.k.a., the node) to
AWS.

This Airnode contains a single API operation (`GET /simple/price`) from
[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) which returns the
current value of a coin. This guide does not detail the overall configuration of
an Airnode, it is just a quick start guide then lends itself to understanding an
Airnode deployment.

Please note that this tutorial does not involve the blockchain nor an RRP
(request-response protocol) call from a smart contract. If you wish to make an
RRP call, please see the guides
[Making an RRP Request](/guides/airnode/rrp-request.md) and
[Calling an Airnode](/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/).

## Configuration Files

An Airnode deployment on AWS uses the Docker
[deployer image](/reference/airnode/latest/docker/deployer-image.md) which
requires three files as input:
[config.json](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/index.md#config-json),
[secrets.env](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/index.md#secrets-env),
and [aws.env](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/index.md#aws-env). These
files have been created and only require a few minor changes to make the
deployment of the Airnode successful. The changes are needed to supply AWS
credentials, a chain provider url, and a mnemonic.

## 1. Install Prerequisites

Install the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and launch it.

## 2. Project Folder

Download the <a href="/zip-files/quick-start-aws.zip" download>
quick-start-aws.zip</a> project folder. Extract it into any location.

```
quick-start-aws
├── aws.env
├── config.json
└── secrets.env
```

## 3. Prepare Configuration Files

Prepare the three configuration files. The Airnode deployer image looks for
`config.json`, `secrets.env`, and `aws.env` in the project root directory and
writes `receipt.json` to the project root folder.

### config.json

::: details config.json

```json
<!--@include: ./src/config.json-->
```

:::

This file requires no changes on your part. It has been created with just one
API endpoint and configured to listen to requests on the Sepolia test network,
though this tutorial will not make any such requests. There are a few variables
this file will interpolate from `secrets.env`.

Note that `nodeSetting.cloudProvider.disableConcurrencyReservations` has been
set to `true`. This is a precaution for new AWS accounts that have yet to
address concurrency management. For production deployments,
`disableConcurrencyReservations` should be set to `false`. See
[disableConcurrencyReservations](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/config-json.md#cloudprovider-disableconcurrencyreservations)
under the `cloudProvider` key and
[maxConcurrency](/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/config-json.md#maxconcurrency)
for more information.

### secrets.env

::: details secrets.env

```sh
<!--@include: ./src/secrets.env-->
```

:::

There are two values `config.json` interpolates from `secrets.env`. Add values
for each of these fields.

- `CHAIN_PROVIDER_URL`: A blockchain provider url from a provider such as
  [Infura](https://www.infura.io/). Use a url for the Sepolia test network. If
  you need one see the page [Create an Infura key](/guides/misc/infura-key/).

- `AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC`: Provide the seed phrase (mnemonic) to a new digital
  wallet. The wallet does not need to be funded. Use the Admin CLI command
  [generate-airnode-mnemonic](/reference/airnode/latest/packages/admin-cli.md#generate-airnode-mnemonic)
  to create one.

  ```sh [generate-airnode-mnemonic]
  npx @api3/airnode-admin generate-airnode-mnemonic
  ```

### aws.env

::: details aws.env

```sh
<!--@include: ./src/aws.env-->
```

:::

Add the access credentials from your AWS account. The deployer image will use
these to install the Airnode functions to Lambda under your account's control.
If you do not have an account watch this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA) to create one. Unlike
`secrets.env`, you cannot surround values with double quotes (").

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Is ACCESS_KEY_ID in IAM.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Is SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in IAM.

## 4. Deploy

Make sure Docker is running and then execute the deployer image from the root of
the `quick-start-aws` folder. A `receipt.json` file will be created upon
completion. It contains some deployment information and is used to remove the
Airnode.

<!-- Use of .html below is intended. -->
<WarningSimultaneousDeployments removeLink="/reference/airnode/latest/docker/deployer-image.html#manual-removal"/>

Run the following command to deploy the Airnode. Normally (for Linux/Mac/WSL2)
the deployer image `deploy` command is run by the user root. This may cause
permission issues when the `receipt.json` file is generated. Optionally you can
specify the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier" target="_blank">UID
(user identifier)</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier" target="\_blank"> GID
(group identifier)</a> that the deployer image should use. Do so by setting the
environment variables USER_ID and GROUP_ID, otherwise omit the line containing
these variables.

::: code-group

```sh [Linux/Mac/WSL2]
docker run -it --rm \
  -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
  -v "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:latest deploy
```

```batch [Windows]
:: For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell).

docker run -it --rm ^
  -v "%cd%:/app/config" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:latest deploy
```

:::

Make note of the `HTTP gateway URL` in your output as shown below as it will be
different. You will need it to test the Airnode.

```sh [output]
✔ Deployed Airnode 0x6A6cF2d0094c73b7aBb22Cd6196824BCBB830125 quick-aws to aws us-east-1
ℹ Outputted config/receipt.json
  This file does not contain any sensitive information.
ℹ HTTP gateway URL: https://0h2jjn4iw0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/6445039b-309e-9173-0320-f0b0731eb34d
```

## 5. Test the Airnode

After a successful deployment the Airnode can be tested directly using its
off-chain [HTTP Gateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md).
As a reminder, this is independent of the blockchain and RRP contract.

### HTTP Gateway

Looking at the `config.json` code snippet below shows that the HTTP gateway is
configured for the Airnode. Furthermore, the endpoint for `/simple/price` (with
an `endpointId` of `0x6...af6`) is present in `triggers.http[n]`. Only those
endpoints added to the `http` array can be tested using the HTTP gateway.

::: details Expand to view: HTTP gateway and endpoint ID

```json
"nodeSettings": {
  ...
  "httpGateway": {
    "enabled": true, // The gateway is activated for this Airnode
    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  ...
},
"triggers": {
  "rrp": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
      "cacheResponses": false
    }
  ],
  "http": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

:::

### Execute Endpoint

Use CURL to execute a HTTP gateway request for the CoinGecko endpoint
`/simple/price`.

As an alternative to CURL, an app such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/) can be used. Windows
users can also use
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
(WSL2) to run CURL on Linux.

In order to test an endpoint, make a HTTP POST request with the `Content-Type`
header set to `application/json`, the endpoint parameters in the request body,
and the `endpointId` as a path parameter.

- `-X`: POST
- `-H`: The `Content-Type` using the value of `application/json`.
- `-d`: Use request body data to pass the endpoint parameter key/value pair.
- `url`:
  - `<httpGatewayUrl>`: The HTTP gateway URL as displayed in the terminal at the
    end of an Airnode deployment, less the `:endpointId` placeholder.
  - <code style="overflow-wrap:break-word;">0x6db9...c27af6</code>: Passed as a
    path parameter, the `endpointId` to call. The value originates from
    `triggers.rrp[0].endpointId` in the `config.json` file.

#### Request

::: code-group

```sh [Linux/Mac/WSL2]
curl -v \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"parameters": {"coinIds": "api3", "coinVs_currencies": "usd"}}' \
'<httpGatewayUrl>/0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6'
```

```batch [Windows]
curl -v ^
-X POST ^
-H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
-d "{\"parameters\": {\"coinIds\": \"api3\", \"coinVs_currencies\": \"usd\"}}" ^
"<httpGatewayUrl>/0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6"
```

:::

#### Response

```json
{
  "rawValue": { "api3": { "usd": 1.18 } },
  "encodedValue": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000120160",
  "values": ["1180000"]
}
```

## 6. Remove the Airnode

When you are done with this guide you can remove the deployed Airnode. The
following command uses the `receipt.json` file that was created when the Airnode
was deployed.

::: code-group

```sh [Linux/Mac/WSL2]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:latest remove-with-receipt
```

```batch [Windows]
:: For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell)

docker run -it --rm ^
  -v "%cd%:/app/config" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:latest remove-with-receipt
```

:::

## Summary

You have deployed an Airnode on AWS with its HTTP gateway enabled. The Airnode,
upon deployment, started contacting the `AirnodeRrpV0` contract on the Sepolia
test network to gather any requests made by requesters to this Airnode. However
this guide did not address making a request on-chain as its purpose was to
quickly deploy a functional Airnode. See the guides
[Making an RRP Request](/guides/airnode/rrp-request.md) and
[Calling an Airnode](/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/) to learn how your
smart contract can make an RRP call to an Airnode.

Finally the API integration was tested using the Airnode's off-chain
[HTTP gateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md). You made
a CURL request (using HTTP) to the HTTP gateway. Airnode queried the API
provider and sent back a response. All of this was performed without accessing
the blockchain.

Learn more about AWS resources that Airnode uses in the
[Cloud Resources](/reference/airnode/latest/cloud-resources.md) doc.
