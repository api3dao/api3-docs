# {{$frontmatter.title}}

This guide demonstrates Airnode's ability to execute its
[`postProcessingSpecifications`](/reference/ois/latest/processing.md) capability
which runs user defined code during its run cycle. The following describes the
workflow Airnode uses:

1. Run `preProcessingSpecifications`
2. Airnode calls requested OIS endpoint
3. Run `postProcessingSpecifications`
4. Airnode encodes the response values defined by reservedParameters

In this guide you will use `postProcessingSpecifications` to get the average
price of the API3 token and its average market cap for the last seven days. This
will be calculated after calling the CoinGecko operation
`/coins/{coin}/market_chart`.

## 1. Setup a Docker container to run Airnode

A local Docker container running Airnode is needed. Go to the guide
[Deploying Airnode locally using Docker](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-container/index.md)
and run steps #1-3. Make the following adjustment when doing so:

- After downloading the
  [Project folder](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-container/#_2-project-folder)
  (step #2) replace the `config.json` file's content with the following content.

::: details Copy/paste config.json

```json
<!--@include: ./src/config.json-->
```

:::

Once the project folder from the **Deploying Airnode locally using Docker**
guide has been downloaded and the `config.json` file updated, return to step #2
below. But first read about the changes made to the newer `config.json` file
shown below.

### `paths`

The newer `config.json` file points to a different API provider operation
(`/coins/{coin}/market_chart`).

```js
"paths": {
  "/coins/{coin}/market_chart": {
    "get": {
      "parameters": [
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
},
```

### `postProcessingSpecifications`

After calling the API provider's operation but before encoding the resulting
values for on-chain use, Airnode will run the post processing code defined in
`postProcessingSpecifications`. During execution of this code, the data from the
API provider operation can be summarized into the values needed.

```js
"preProcessingSpecifications": [],
"postProcessingSpecifications": [
  {
    "environment": "Node",
    "timeoutMs": 5000,
    "value": "   let avg_price = 0;   let avg_market_cap = 0;   input.prices.forEach(el => { avg_price = avg_price + el[1]; });   input.avg_price = (avg_price / 7).toString();   input.market_caps.forEach(el => { avg_market_cap = avg_market_cap + el[1]; });   input.avg_market_cap = (avg_market_cap / 7).toString();   output = input;   "
  }
]
```

Below is a more human readable rendering of the post processing code. The
`input` variable contains the response from the API provider's operation. The
`output` variable must be set before the code exists as Airnode uses it to
encode any values for use on-chain. See more about
[Input and Output](/reference/ois/latest/processing.md#input-and-output) in the
OIS reference.

```js
let avg_price = 0;
let avg_market_cap = 0;
input.prices.forEach((el) => {
  avg_price = avg_price + el[1];
});
input.avg_price = (avg_price / 7).toString();
input.market_caps.forEach((el) => {
  avg_market_cap = avg_market_cap + el[1];
});
input.avg_market_cap = (avg_market_cap / 7).toString();
output = input;
```

## 2. Deploy the Docker container

From your project root run the Docker container deploy command. It will use the
updated `config.json` file.

::: code-group

```sh [Mac/WSL2/PowerShell]
docker run \
  --volume "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  --name quick-start-container-airnode \
  --publish 3000:3000 \
  api3/airnode-client:latest
```

```batch [Windows CMD]
docker run ^
  --volume "%cd%:/app/config" ^
  --name quick-start-container-airnode ^
  --publish 3000:3000 ^
  api3/airnode-client:latest
```

```sh [Linux (host networking)]
docker run \
  --volume "$(pwd):/app/config" \
  --name quick-start-container-airnode \
  --network host \
  api3/airnode-client:latest
```

:::

Leave the command active in the terminal window. It will display the log items
resulting from the container's deployment. Note the line in the output contains
the `httpGateway` URL which you will use in step #3.

```sh (2)
...
[2023-06-06 21:49:44.596] INFO HTTP (testing) gateway listening for request on "http://localhost:3000/http-data/01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-012345678abc/:endpointId"
...

```

## 3. Call the Airnode endpoint

Use CURL and call the Airnode endpoint that gets the market data from the
CoinGecko operation `/coins/{coin}/market_chart`. The CURL command will call the
httpGateway exposed by the Airnode. This avoids the need to use a smart contract
to get the response. The
[httpGateway](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md) is a
testing tool not normally enabled on production systems.

### Request

```sh
# For Windows CMD replace line termination marker \ with ^
curl -X POST \
  -d '{"parameters":{"air_coin":"api3","air_vs_currency":"usd"}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  'http://localhost:3000/http-data/01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-012345678abc/0x2de6e288ed16965b68a62d4b2a747b094b3c857941285e625bed3a7be31445e4' | json_pp
```

### Response

```sh
# response
{
   "encodedValue" : "0x0...58a",
   "rawValue" : {
      "avg_market_cap" : "106632586.97711395",
      "avg_price" : "1.2477250309068642",
      "market_caps" : [
         [
            1685577600000,
            105212548.064737
         ],
         ...
      ],
      "prices" : [
         [
            1685577600000,
            1.23324995186942
         ],
         ...
      ],
      "total_volumes" : [
         [
            1685577600000,
            3074677.52645394
         ],
         ...
         ]
      ]
   },
   "values" : [
      "1247725",
      "106632586"
   ]
}
```

The data retrieved from the API provider CoinGecko (`market_caps`, `prices`, and
`total_volumes` ) was added to the `rawValue` field. Then the `rawValue` (as the
`input` variable) was "piped" through the `postProcessingSpecifications` user
defined code which in turn calculated the price and market cap averages which
were added back into `rawValue` via the `output` variable.

- `"avg_price" : "1.2477250309068642"`
- `"avg_market_cap" : "106632586.97711395"`

After the `postProcessingSpecifications` user defined code exited Airnode used
the mappings of the `reservedParameters` field in the `config.json` file to
determine what data should go into the `values` field. Airnode then encoded the
values into the `encodedValue` field suitable for use on-chain.

## 4. Verify `encodedValue`

Verify that `encodedValue` actually contains the two numbers in the `values`
field. Copy and paste the `encodedValue` string you received after executing the
Airnode endpoint into the form below and select the **Decode** button.

## Summary

In this guide you extended the data from the API operation with additional
summary values using post processing. For more examples on how to use
`preProcessingSpecifications` and `postProcessingSpecifications` see the
following monorepo examples.
