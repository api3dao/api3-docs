# Searchers

This part of the docs is dedicated to searchers. It details how OEV auctions
work and explains basic searching strategies to simplify the onboarding of
existing MEV searchers to OEV.

## OEV dApps Catalog

We maintain an open-source list of all dApps that have integrated API3 feeds as
part of the [dApp Registry](https://github.com/api3dao/dapp-registry). However,
not all of the dApps are suitable for OEV extraction, so we provide a separate
list of currently suitable candidates for OEV searching.

<!-- NOTE: Make sure these are sorted alphabetically. -->

1. [Hana protocol on Taiko](https://www.hana.finance/)
2. [Lendle protocol on Mantle](https://lendle.xyz/)
3. [Orbit protocol on Blast](https://orbitlending.io/)
4. [Silo protocol on Arbitrum](https://app.silo.finance/)
5. [Yei protocol on Sei](https://www.yei.finance/)

Currently, these protocols use outdated API3 proxies that support the previous
version of OEV auctions, which are no longer supported. Searchers can still
perform [MEV with Signed APIs](/oev-searchers/in-depth/mev-with-signed-apis)
extraction though.

## From MEV Searching

MEV searching has a well-established community and expertise in securing health
and stability across many dApps and chains. We want to motivate this community
to join OEV searching by outlining the steps to transition from MEV to OEV.

Let's emphasize that MEV searchers can still use their existing infrastructure
and searching bots even when opting into OEV. OEV should be treated as an
extension to MEV that searchers can capitalize on. OEV can increase profits by
outperforming the competition and paying less to block validators.

The following is a list of things that need to be done to enable an existing MEV
bot to participate in OEV searching:

1. [Bridge funds](/oev-searchers/in-depth/oev-network/#bridging-eth) to the OEV
   network
2. Deposit funds to the OevAuctionHouse contract
3. Monitor off-chain signed data for dAPIs used by the dApp
4. Simulate the data feed update on-chain to determine OEV opportunities
5. Place a bid on the OEV Network
6. Wait for auction award
7. Use the award to update the on-chain data feed on target chain and capture
   the OEV

Most of these steps require small additions to the existing MEV bot, but it is
required to understand the mental model behind OEV and our
[dAPIs](#/oev-searchers/in-depth/dapis/). Because of this, we recommend starting
with an in-between solution we call
[MEV with Signed APIs](/oev-searchers/in-depth/mev-with-signed-apis).
