# Examples

We've decided to launch our own dApp built with Api3 OEV proxies with minimal
liquidity. This allows us to build a fully functional OEV bot and share it as a
reference without promoting a particular dApp. Because of the small liquidity,
we expect very little competition, making it an ideal way to start with OEV.

## Compound3 Fork

::: warning

The dApp uses real assets to allow for a more realistic experience, but the goal
is to allow testing of the OEV flow. If you're just looking to borrow/lend
assets, use the real Compound dApp or another platform instead.

:::

The dApp is a Compound3 fork launched on the Base network. The dApp offers a
very basic UI for borrowing and lending assets. It mirrors the real
[USDC comet on Base](https://app.compound.finance/markets/usdc-basemainnet) and
allows for borrowing USDC by supplying any of ETH, cbETH, or wstETH as
collateral.

Refer to this table for dApp details:
