# `data-feed-proxy-combinators`

The [`data-feed-proxy-combinators`](https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-proxy-combinators) repository provides a powerful toolkit of modular smart contracts. These "combinators" allow you to create new, customized data feeds by transforming and combining existing Api3 feeds or even external data feeds. This is particularly useful when your dApp requires a data feed that is not directly available on the Api3 Market.

## Core Components

The repository offers the following suite of composable contracts:

- **`InverseApi3ReaderProxyV1.sol`**: Computes the inverse of a data feed's value (e.g., converting ETH/USD to USD/ETH).
- **`ProductApi3ReaderProxyV1.sol`**: Multiplies the values of two data feeds to derive a new cross-rate (e.g., multiplying "wstETH/stETH Exchange Rate" with ETH/USD feed to get wstETH/USD).
- **`PriceCappedApi3ReaderProxyV1.sol`**: Enforces a price ceiling and/or floor on a data feed's value.
- **`NormalizedApi3ReaderProxyV1.sol`**: Adapts an external feed using the Chainlink `AggregatorV2V3Interface` interface to the Api3 `IApi3ReaderProxy` interface, normalizing its value to 18 decimals.
- **`ScaledApi3FeedProxyV1.sol`**: An adapter that changes the decimal precision of a data feed and exposes it via the standard `AggregatorV2V3Interface` interface.

## Usage and Examples

The usage and examples are documented in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-proxy-combinators/blob/main/README.md) of the repository.
