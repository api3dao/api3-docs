# Contract integration

This page provides important information on how to integrate Api3 data feeds into a contract.
Please read it in its entirety before attempting an integration.

::: info ⚠️ Warning

Api3 does not authorize any members or affiliates to provide security advice.
You are solely responsible for following the instructions on this page.

## Api3ReaderProxyV1

Api3ReaderProxyV1 is a contract that is used to read a specific Api3 data feed.
For example, to read ETH/USD on Blast, one can simply call the [`read()` function](https://blastscan.io/address/0x5b0cf2b36a65a6BB085D501B971e4c102B9Cd473#readProxyContract#F17) of a respective Api3ReaderProxyV1.

You can use Api3 Market to see the Api3ReaderProxyV1 address you should use for a specific data feed, as described [here.](/dapps/integration/index.md#integration-information)
To summarize, you should use the Api3ReaderProxyV1 address that appears after selecting "Earn OEV Rewards" and entering the name of your dApp.

::: info ⚠️ Warning

To be eligible for OEV Rewards, you are required to use the Api3ReaderProxyV1 contracts belonging to your dApp.

:::

### Printing Api3ReaderProxyV1 addresses

For your convenience, Api3 representatives may deploy OEV Rewards-enabled Api3ReaderProxyV1 contracts on your behalf and provide you with a list of commands that will print their addresses.
By running these commands yourself, you can ensure that you are using the correct addresses.

::: info 💡 Tip

We try to verify our contracts on all block explorers, with varying success due to their practical limitations.
Since Api3ReaderProxyV1 is deployed deterministically, the lack of verification on a block explorer does not pose a security concern.

:::

These commands should be in the following format, where the dApp alias (assigned to you by Api3 during [registration](/dapps/oev-rewards/index.md#how-to-get-onboard)), chain ID, and dAPI names match your specific case:

```sh
npx @api3/contracts@latest print-api3readerproxyv1-address \
  --dapp-alias lendle \
  --chain-id 5000 \
  --dapi-name ETH/USD
```

The command above prints:

```
dApp alias: lendle
chain: Mantle
dAPI name: ETH/USD
• Please confirm that https://market.api3.org/mantle/eth-usd points to an active feed.
• Your proxy address is https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x776E79D916e49BBDb8FEe0F43fF148C2Ed3bE125
Please confirm that there is a contract deployed at this address before using it.
```

Note that if an Api3 representative has provided you with this command, you can expect the Market page to point to an active feed and the proxy to already be deployed.
Do not proceed with the integration until you confirm both conditions.

### Reading the data feed

Api3ReaderProxyV1 implements IApi3ReaderProxy, which you can import from [`@api3/contracts`](/dapps/integration/api3-contracts.md) to use in your contract.

```solidity
interface IApi3ReaderProxy {
    function read() external view returns (int224 value, uint32 timestamp);
}
```

::: info 💡 Tip

Api3ReaderProxyV1 also implements Chainlink's AggregatorV2V3Interface, which enables it to be used as a drop-in replacement for Chainlink data feeds.
Refer to the [AggregatorV2V3Interface page](/dapps/integration/aggregatorv2v3interface.md) for details.

:::

#### Using `value`

`value` is an `int224`, which is the median of individual on-chain data feed `value`s that contribute to the aggregation.

::: info 💡 Tip

Note that `value` has a signed type.
However, in the context of a data feed that reports the price of an asset, non-positive values do not make sense.
It is good practice to validate against such conditions, as in `require(value > 0)`.

:::

All Api3 data feeds have 18 decimals.
For example, if ETH/USD is `2918.5652133`, `value` will read `2918565213300000000000`.

::: info ⚠️ Warning

It is extremely risky to validate the data feed value based on practical assumptions.
An example where doing so went wrong was Chainlink requiring their LUNA/USD data feed value to be at least `0.1`.
Doing so caused them to misreport by an order of magnitude during the UST depeg, and caused a dApp to suffer more than $14MM in damages.

We do not utilize such heuristics on our end, and recommend that you be very careful if you do.

:::

#### Using `timestamp`

`timestamp` is a `uint32`, which is the median of individual on-chain data feed `timestamp`s that contribute to the aggregation.
The `timestamp` of an individual data feed represents the system timestamp that the respective API provider reported when they called their API to get the value.
Its main role is to act as a nonce that prevents data feed updates from being replayed.

::: info ⚠️ Warning

`timestamp` is not the block timestamp at the time of the update.
It is the reported system (i.e., off-chain) time.
One common mistake is using `require(timestamp <= block.timestamp)`.
This check should be avoided for two reasons:

1. If `block.timestamp` lags compared to actual time, this will revert.
   However, that is not a valid reason to avoid using the data feed, as doing so will cause unnecessary downtime for your contract.
2. Some L2 implementations use the timestamp of the latest block as `block.timestamp` (rather than the system time of the node) when a static call is made to the RPC endpoint.
   This means that the `require()` will revert during static calls even when `block.timestamp` does not actually lag.
   This prevents OEV searchers from using the intended workflow and reduces the amount of OEV Rewards you will receive in practice.

:::

In general, the only acceptable use of `timestamp` is validating whether the heartbeat interval is upheld, as in `require(timestamp + 24 hours > block.timestamp)`.
However, unless your contract design specifically relies on the data feed value being at most a day old (which is unlikely), we do not necessarily recommend this approach either.

::: info 💡 Tip

Your auditors may not be familiar with best practices in the context of Api3 data feeds.
We recommend directing them to this page.

## Api3ReaderProxyV1 combinations

See the [`data-feed-proxy-combinators`](https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-proxy-combinators) repository for various modular contracts that you can use to create combinations out of Api3ReaderProxyV1 contracts.
For example, you can combine an `ETH/USD` Api3ReaderProxyV1 contract and a `wstETH/ETH Exchange Rate` Api3ReaderProxyV1 contract to read a `wstETH/USD` value.
