# Contract integration

This page provides important information on how to integrate API3 data feeds to a contract.
Please read it in its entirety before attempting an integration.

::: info ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

API3 does not authorize any member or affiliate to provide security advice.
You are solely responsible for following the instructions on this page.

## Api3ReaderProxyV1

Api3ReaderProxyV1 is a contract that is used to read a specific API3 data feed.
For example, to read ETH/USD on Blast, one can simply call the [`read()` function](https://blastscan.io/address/0x5b0cf2b36a65a6BB085D501B971e4c102B9Cd473#readProxyContract#F17) of a respective Api3ReaderProxyV1.

The Api3ReaderProxyV1 addresses displayed on API3 Market are communal‚Äîthey do not belong to a specific dApp.
Alternatively, an Api3ReaderProxyV1 can belong to a specific dApp, which is required for [OEV Rewards](/dapps/oev-rewards/) support.
There is no other functional difference between the two.

### Printing dApp-specific Api3ReaderProxyV1 addresses

API3 representatives will assign your [dApp alias](/dapps/oev-rewards/dapp-alias.md), deploy your dApp-specific Api3ReaderProxyV1 contracts, and give you a list of commands that will print their addresses.
By running these commands yourself, you can ensure that you are using the correct addresses.

::: info üí° Tip

We try to verify our contracts on all block explorers with varying success due to their practical limitations.
Since Api3ReaderProxyV1 is deployed deterministically, it not being verified on a block explorer is not a security concern.

:::

These commands should be in the following format, where the dApp alias, chain ID, and dAPI names match your case:

```sh
npx @api3/contracts@latest print-api3readerproxyv1-address \
  --dapp-alias lendle \
  --chain-id 5000 \
  --dapi-name ETH/USD
```

The command above prints:

```
dApp alias: lendle
chain: Mantle
dAPI name: ETH/USD
‚Ä¢ Please confirm that https://market.api3.org/mantle/eth-usd points to an active feed.
‚Ä¢ Your proxy address is https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x776E79D916e49BBDb8FEe0F43fF148C2Ed3bE125
Please confirm that there is a contract deployed at this address before using it.
```

Note that if an API3 representative has provided you with this command, you can expect the Market page to point to an active feed and the proxy to be already deployed.
Do not proceed with the integration until you confirm these.

::: info üí° Tip

If you are using the API3 Market in a self-serve manner and want to use dApp-specific Api3ReaderProxyV1 contracts, see the [Api3ReaderProxyV1 deployment guide](/dapps/integration/api3readerproxyv1-deployment).

### Reading the data feed

Api3ReaderProxyV1 implements IApi3ReaderProxy, which you can import from [`@api3/contracts`](/dapps/integration/api3-contracts.md) to use in your contract.

```solidity
interface IApi3ReaderProxy {
    function read() external view returns (int224 value, uint32 timestamp);
}
```

::: info üí° Tip

Api3ReaderProxyV1 also implements Chainlink's AggregatorV2V3Interface, which enables it to be used as a drop-in replacement for Chainlink data feeds.
Refer to the [AggregatorV2V3Interface page](/dapps/integration/aggregatorv2v3interface.md) for details.

:::

#### Using `value`

`value` is an `int224`, which is the median of individual on-chain data feed `value`s that contribute to the aggregation.

::: info üí° Tip

Note that `value` has a signed type.
However, in the context of a data feed that reports the price of an asset, non-positive values do not make sense.
It is good practice to validate such conditions, as in `require(value > 0)`.

:::

All API3 data feeds have 18 decimals.
For example, if ETH/USD is `2918.5652133`, `value` will read `2918565213300000000000`.

::: info ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

It is extremely risky to validate the data feed value based on practical assumptions.
An example where doing so went wrong was Chainlink requiring their LUNA/USD data feed value to be at least `0.1`.
Doing so caused them to misreport by an order or magnitude during the UST depeg, and caused a dApp to suffer more than $14MM in damages.

We do not utilize such heuristics at our end, and recommend you to be very careful if you do.

:::

#### Using `timestamp`

`timestamp` is a `uint32`, which is the median of individual on-chain data feed `timestamp`s that contribute to the aggregation.
The `timestamp` of an individual data feed is what the respective API provider reported their system timestamp to be at the time they called their API to get the value.
Its main role is to act as a nonce that prevents data feed updates from being replayed.

::: info ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

`timestamp` is not the block timestamp at the time of the update.
It is the reported system (i.e., off-chain) time.
A common mistake is using `require(timestamp <= block.timestamp)`.
This should be avoided for two reasons:

1. If `block.timestamp` lags compared to actual time, this will revert.
   However, that is not a valid reason to avoid using the data feed, and will cause unnecessary downtime for your contract.
2. Some L2 implementations use the timestamp of the latest block as `block.timestamp` (rather than the system time of the node) when a static call is made to the RPC endpoint.
   This means that this `require()` will revert during static calls even when `block.timestamp` does not actually lag.
   This disables OEV searchers from using the intended workflow, and will reduce the amount of OEV Rewards you will receive in practice.

:::

In general, the only acceptable use of `timestamp` is validating if the heartbeat interval is upheld, as in `require(timestamp + 24 hours > block.timestamp)`.
However, unless your contract design specifically relies on the data feed value being at most a day old (which is unlikely), we do not necessarily recommend this either.

::: info üí° Tip

Your auditors may not be familiar with the best practices in the context of API3 data feeds.
It is a good idea to direct them to this page.

:::

## Mixed oracle design

Some dApps choose to mix oracle solutions, either by refusing service if they are not in consensus, or by using one primarily and deferring to another in case of inconsistency.

In such setups, API3 data feeds need to be treated differently due to OEV considerations.
Specifically, the vast majority of OEV is extracted during times of volatility, and letting other oracle solutions interfere during such times may result in losing out on a significant amount of OEV revenue.
In practice, this will play out as an OEV searcher bidding a significant amount for a detected OEV opportunity, only to realize after the auction ends that the dApp now defers to a non-API3 data feed and the OEV opportunity no longer exists.
Such ambiguity will put off OEV searchers from your dApp, or cause them to bid much less to hedge the risk, reducing your [OEV Rewards](/dapps/oev-rewards/).

The golden standard is only using API3 data feeds, in which case OEV searchers will be able to bid on OEV opportunities with full confidence, knowing that they will be able to extract if they win the auction.
If you must use API3 data feeds as your primary source with another solution as fallback, you should tolerate as much inconsistency as possible.

::: info üí° Tip

We recommend you to tolerate at least 10% inconsistency.
Based on our analysis, any less will hinder OEV extraction during times of high volatility.

:::

Note that using API3 data feeds for only some asset prices still counts as a mixed design.
Say a lending platform uses the ETH/USD API3 data feed, and the USDT/USD data feed of another oracle solution.
A user takes out a USDT loan with ETH collateral, and the following price action renders the position liquidatable once the ETH/USD data feed is updated.
Even if an OEV searcher detects the opportunity, they must consider that a rogue USDT/USD update by the other oracle solution may expose it to the public before they can claim it, which causes them to avoid bidding a fair amount.

::: info üí∞ Financial

It is up to you to maximize your OEV Rewards by integrating correctly.
Not maximizing OEV Rewards causes loss of profits and thus is a security issue.
