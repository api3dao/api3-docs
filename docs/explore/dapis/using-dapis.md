As outlined on the page [What are dAPIs?](/explore/dapis/what-are-dapis.md),
API3 has created a unified, user-friendly implementation that is designed to
simplify the process of obtaining data feed services. The API3 Market enables
dApp owners to connect to a decentralized API and access its data feeds. There
are two types of dAPIs:

- Self-funded dAPIs
- Managed dAPIs

## Self-funded dAPIs

Self-funded dAPIs currently rely on a single first-party oracle. They offer dApp
owners the opportunity to make use of data feeds with minimal up-front
commitment and are accessible
[permissionlessly](https://www.gemini.com/en-US/cryptopedia/what-is-permissionless-crypto-permissionlessness-blockchain)
for developers.

### Using Self-funded dAPIs

Self-funded dAPIs require any dApp owner to provide funds into a sponsor wallet.
These funds are used by the first-party oracle, that supports a particular data
feed, to pay gas costs when placing the value of the data feed on-chain. Once
sufficient funds are available, updates will begin automatically within a 15
minute window. In accordance with deviation thresholds and heartbeat these funds
will be used to maintain the on-chain price of the respective dAPI until they
are depleted. In many cases you will find that the a dAPI's sponsor wallet has
already been funded and any dApp owner can proceed to use the dAPI.

<!--Self-funded dAPIs currently rely on a single first-party oracle and projects utilizing these in production and high value use cases should consider the risk and security implications.

[security considerations](/explore/dapis/security-considerations.md)-->

### Accessing a self-funded dAPI

The [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org) features a user-friendly UI that
enables easy activation and management of self-funded dAPIs. To use a
self-funded data feed you:

- Select a data feed within the API3 Market
- [Fund a sponsor wallet](/guides/dapis/subscribing-self-funded-dapis/) (if not
  already funded)
- Deploy the proxy contract (if not already deployed)
- [Read the dAPI](/guides/dapis/read-a-dapi/)

The dAPI integration process has been designed to be simple and abstract away
any further technical lifting, offering a standardized implementation for all
data feeds. Developers then obtain the value of by reading the dAPIs value using
a [proxy contract](/reference/dapis/understand/proxy-contracts.md).

### Why use self-funded dAPIs

A self-funded data feed provides advantages for dApp owners:

- Developers can utilize dAPIs in a permissionless fashion using the self-serve
  tooling within the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis)
- Developers have the ability to use a first-party oracle within early stages of
  the development life cycle without an ongoing commitment
- dApps that may only require data feeds for a short period of time can activate
  a self-funded dAPI as needed

<!--Additionally, the API3 Market provides an intuitive interface to check the
status of respective self-funded dAPIs and fund them accordingly.-->

## Managed dAPIs

Managed dAPIs are sourced from multiple first-party oracles and aggregated using
a median function.

### Accessing Managed dAPIs

When available, self-funded dAPIs can be upgraded to a managed dAPI by paying
the API3 DAO. The API3 Market will facilitate this process and allow potential
users to specify desired amount of first-party oracles that should be included
in the aggregation. API3 will create the respective
[beacon set](/reference/dapis/understand/index.md) for a dAPI from the best
available first-party oracles for the requested data set and point the dAPI
towards this creation.

In addition, API3 takes over the gas management overhead associated with
operating managed dAPIs. Compared to self-funded dAPIs, managed dAPIs are
monetized, as API3 requires payment in USDC on Ethereum Mainnet to operate them.
API3 recommends the usage of managed dAPIs in high value production use cases.

# API3 Market

The API3 Market lists all available dAPIs, self-funded and managed dAPis. It
represents a hub that allows developers to:

- Browse through a catalogue of potential data feeds to integrate
- Fund their operation in the case of self-funded dAPIs
- Pay for the upgrade to a managed version
- Request new data types

You can head to the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis) now and use
self-funded dAPIs.
