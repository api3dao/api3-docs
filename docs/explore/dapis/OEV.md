Oracle extractable value (OEV) refers to oracles making use of their position to
capture value that would otherwise have gone to third parties.

### What is OEV?

Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) is a subset of MEV related to the way oracles are
currently designed. Any update to data feeds, or a lack thereof, can create
opportunities for OEV such as arbitrage and liquidations. During each of these
interactions value is leaking from the dApp users to both searchers and
validators. Learn more about OEV in a summary of the
[OEV Litepaper](https://medium.com/api3/oracle-extractable-value-oev-13c1b6d53c5b).

### Leveraging OEV alongside dAPIs

Integrating OEV data feeds can turn this fee previously being imposed on your
users into a powerful economic incentive driving value to your ecosystem. OEV
data feeds will maximize the value returned to your dapp from OEV through a
sealed bid auction process similar to the one you might be familiar with from
Flashbots and MEV-Boost.

Instead of overpaying for liquidations with a fixed incentive, that during large
liquidation opportunities can be much too high than it needs to be, a sealed bid
auction hosted at the oracle can minimize the value being paid out and return
most of it back to the dapp. The liquidations will also be able to occur in a
more timely manner because you do not have to wait for a deviation threshold to
trigger oracle updates, creating a lower latency and more robust liquidation
process.

### Re-directing MEV to dApps

Within certain DeFi protocols the arbitrage created due to oracle latency can
undermine the ability for an LPs ability to be profitable. In turn this forces
protocols, particularly derivatives, to impose higher fees on users. Capturing
OEV at the data feed level can help improve LP profitability by auctioning off
the arbitrage opportunities and returning the corresponding value to dApps. More
accurate data and value capture from the auction can be used to increase
profitability and sustainability of liquidity provision, allowing for a more
optimal market making protocol for apps that use oracles. Better market making
from a dapps LPs creates a flywheel effect of drawing more liquidity to the
application while being able to lower fees and list more assets, which then
attracts more users and volume.
