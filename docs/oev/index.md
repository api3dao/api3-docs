# What is OEV?

Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) is a subset of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)
that occurs as a result of an oracle update. Traditional oracle solutions update
data feeds blindly, which is wasteful and provides poor granularity.

OEV is an addition to these regular oracle updates to improve efficiency and
granularity of the price feeds. The idea is that not all oracle updates are the
same. Some oracle updates expose opportunities on the market which can be
captured by "searchers". Searchers monitor the market for profitable
opportunities and compete with each other to realize them first - paying the
majority of the exposed value to block validators in the process. This dynamic
is unhealthy, because the majority of the value should be split between the dApp
and the searcher who realized the opportunity.

OEV aims to solve this problem by auctioning off the exclusive rights to execute
the oracle update(s), allowing the winner to atomically update the price feed(s)
and capture the opportunity on the market. Because of the exclusive rights to
update the price feed, the searcher is able to pay smaller gas fees, because
there is no competition. On the other hand, the auction proceeds are distributed
back to the dApp which created this opportunity.

With OEV, the searcher can announce the desire for a particular oracle update
along with the amount willing to pay for it. There is an open auction, bound by
certain rules, which selects a winner. The winner must pay the announced amount
and as a result is able to use the oracle update to capture the opportunity.

**Basic Example**

Imagine a basic overcollateralized lending platform, which uses an oracle for
its price feeds to ensure the price remains up-to-date. Borrowers of the
protocol can be liquidated with some incentive if their position becomes
unhealthy to ensure the protocol remains solvent. Say liquidations can occur if
the loan-to-value ratio is over 90%. Let's look at what happens with the
protocol's health over time.

Assume that initially there are no unhealthy positions. Many of the price feed
updates that happen are "unnecessary", because they don't expose any unhealthy
positions and the protocol remains healthy. However, say in time there is a
price drop that causes many of the positions which used that asset as collateral
to get close to the 90% liquidation threshold.

The next price update that causes a position to become unhealthy has some
intrinsic value. From the protocol's perspective, this affects its solvency and
presents a threat. On the other hand, for a searcher this poses a profitable
opportunity. The intrinsic value of the price update is equal to the profit the
searcher can make - the liquidation incentive minus the operational gas costs.

A searcher monitors the dApp and sees that this opportunity is soon to become
unhealthy. They announce that they want to execute the price feed update and pay
X in return. They win the auction, pay X and make the oracle update and
liquidation atomically.

The concept of OEV is not tailored to liquidations only, but can occur anywhere
where price feed updates occur, such as arbitrage and many more.

## Benefits of OEV

OEV offers advantages to various stakeholders in the ecosystem:

1. For dApps:

   - Receive a major share of the value generated from their protocol's oracle
     updates.
   - Improved efficiency, stability and granularity of price feeds.

2. For Searchers:

   - Lower gas fees and in general, higher profits.
   - Guaranteed exclusive update rights.

### OEV proceeds distribution

For a searcher to be able to update the data feed, they must pay the adequate
bid amount, which they announced in the auction. In return, they get exclusive
rights to capture the OEV. Searchers are compensated for this activity by the
liquidation incentive, which is proven to be enough.

At API3, we believe those operating the protocol should be compensated much
more - after all, they are the ones who created the opportunity. As such, all of
the bid amounts paid are distributed back to the dApp.

The bid amount payments happen on the target chain of the protocol. The
accumulated payment amount can be easily computed from on-chain events, so there
is absolute transparency in the process. The funds are withdrawable by API3 DAO,
which will be responsible for distributing the funds.

## How Auctions work?

API3 has delivered a specialized Order Flow Auction (OFA) that maximizes the
value returned to your dApp from OEV through a sealed bid on-chain auction
process similar to the one you might be familiar with from Flashbots and
MEV-Boost.

<!-- TODO: Mention audits -->

We use a combination of the OEV Network and the OEV Auctioneer to power the OEV
auctions in a secure and transparent way.

At a high level, auctions repeat continuously and indefinitely. There is a
separate auction for each dApp. Each auction takes a fixed amount of time.
Searchers place bids during an auction and announce a bid amount they're willing
to pay. When the auction ends, the highest bidder is announced as the winner of
the auction and provided a cryptographic signature. The signature gives them
exclusive rights to update any price feed(s) for the dApp for a limited amount
of time. Each time an auction ends, a new one is started and the same process
repeats.

After auction winner fulfills their duties by paying the pre-announced bid
amount, they need to report this back to OEV network. If they fail to do so,
part of their collateral gets slashed. This is an important security aspect to
prevent denying OEV recapture by withholding auction updates.

### dApp IDs

Each dApp that uses OEV feeds is assigned an unique ID, call "dApp ID". The
granularity of auctions is at the dApp level. All of the dApp proxies use the
same dApp ID.

::: info

The auction winner may update single, multiple or all proxies associated with
the same dApp ID before capturing the OEV opportunity. The ID has no other
meaning other than to group proxies of the same dApp together.

### OEV Network

The OEV Network is hosting auctions in a transparent way, ensuring any disputes
can be resolved by looking at the on-chain data. Searchers submit their bids
on-chain, where the winner is announced and given the exclusive rights to
execute the oracle update. All of the auction steps can be verified by looking
at the on-chain data, ensuring honest and transparent auctions.

To learn more about the OEV Network, refer to the
[OEV Network documentation](/oev/overview/oev-network).

### OEV Auctioneer

A key component to OEV is an off-chain auction system that processes the
auctions happening on the OEV network. We call this system the OEV Auctioneer,
and it is managed by the API3 DAO. The honesty of OEV Auctioneer is ensured by
using OEV Network for all important actions, such as announcing the winner and
the bid amount.

To learn more about the OEV Auctioneer, refer to the
[OEV Auctioneer documentation](/oev/overview/oev-auctioneer).
