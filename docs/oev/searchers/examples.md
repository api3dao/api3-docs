# Examples

We've decided to launch our own dApp built with API3 OEV proxies with minimal
liquidity. This allows us to build a fully functional OEV bot and share that as
a reference without promoting a particular dApp. Because of the small liquidity,
we expect very little competition making it an ideal way to start with OEV.

## Compound3 fork

::: warning

The dApp is using real assets to allow for a more realistic experience, but the
goal is to allow testing OEV flow. If you're just looking to borrow/lend assets,
use the real Compound dApp or other platform instead.

:::

The dApp is a Compound3 fork launched on a Base network. The dApp offers a very
basic UI for borrowing and lending assets. It mirrors the
[real USDC Comet on Base](https://app.compound.finance/markets/usdc-basemainnet)
and allows for borrowing USDC by supplying and of the ETH, cbETH, wstETH as
collateral.

Refer to this table for dApp's details:
