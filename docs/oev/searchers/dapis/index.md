# dAPIs

Searchers need a way to monitor real-time off-chain prices to find profitable
opportunities. Normally, searchers need to buy API subscriptions of the
underlying oracle sources, creating additional friction in the process. API3
simplifies this process by providing the same data that is used for updating the
dAPIs to the searchers publicly - and without cost.

The price feed solution from API3 is called dAPIs and their design allows
extracting OEV with ease.

## How dAPIs Work?

Let's start from the ground up. The dAPI logic is dictated by the Api3ServerV1
contract. The central part of API3 feeds are first-party oracle, relying on
cryptographic signatures verified on-chain.

### dAPI Structure

The simplest primitive is a "beacon".

<!-- NOTE: Source = https://excalidraw.com/#json=yxJpy6HX2MfkDhYU50FZA,-9KIXahH1QnCKmjCpkonPA -->
<img src="./beacon.svg" />

It consists of:

- Airnode address = The identifier of the data provider, e.g. Nodary.
- Template ID = A template represents an endpoint of the data provider API, e.g.
  ETH/USD.

Together they represent a data point from a specific data provider. Beacons are
identified by the hash of their Airnode address and template ID. Beacons are
aggregated into "beacon sets" and identified by the IDs of the constituent
beacons.

<!-- NOTE: Source = https://excalidraw.com/#json=nMEuUgnoInKUysNfxOmYQ,syyRUbVMdsXvIwSLytYmlw -->
<img src="./beacon-set.svg" />

Both beacons and beacon sets can be used as price feeds. The latter are
preferred because of the aggregation. We use term "data feed" to refer to either
of them. Finally, a dAPI is simply a mapping from a human readable name to a
data feed.

### Updating dAPI Value

So far, we've referred to dAPIs and data feeds as sources of data, not
mentioning these are kept up-to-date. API3 feeds are permissionless and anyone
can do an update, provided they have a valid data. To update a beacon, anyone
can call `updateBeaconWithSignedData` on the Api3ServerV1 contract:

```solidity
function updateBeaconWithSignedData(
    address airnode, // Airnode address of the beacon to update
    bytes32 templateId, // Template ID of the beacon to update
    uint256 timestamp, // The off-chain timestamp of the data
    bytes calldata data, // The encoded price feed data (decoded as int256 internally)
    bytes calldata signature // The signature of the fields above signed by the airnode wallet (owned by the data provider).
) external returns (bytes32 beaconId);
```

Similarly, to update a beacon set, one first updates the constituent beacons and
then calls the `updateBeaconSetWithBeacons`:

```solidity
function updateBeaconSetWithBeacons(
    bytes32[] memory beaconIds // The beacon IDs of the constituent beacons
) external returns (bytes32 beaconSetId);
```

By updating a beacon set, we aggregate the values and timestamps of the
constituent beacons. The typical dAPI refers to a beacon set of multiple
sources. Modifying the underlying beacon set updates also the dAPI value.

### Off-chain Components

There are a few off-chain components which are used to keep dAPI values up to
date:

1. [Airnode feed](https://github.com/api3dao/signed-api/tree/main/packages/airnode-feed) -
   Deployed by the data provider themselves, Airnode feed continuously queries
   the API of the data provider, processes the response and signs it by the
   Airnode wallet. The cryptographically signed data is then pushed to Signed
   APIs.
2. [Signed API](https://github.com/api3dao/signed-api/tree/main/packages/signed-api) -
   Signed API accepts signed data from API providers and provides and API layer
   for off-chain querying.
3. [Airseeker](https://github.com/api3dao/airseeker) - Airseeker is an API3 push
   oracle. It monitors the off-chain and on-chain data and causes an update is
   needed.

All of these tools are open sourced for transparency.

### Update Schedule

dAPIs are updated based on the configured update parameters. An update is
performed whenever the dAPI value exceeds the allowed threshold or the feed was
not updated for a long time.

## OEV Updates

After a dAPI is updated, the changed value is reflected across all protocols
that use the particular dAPI. We call these "base feed updates" to differentiate
them from the OEV updates, made by the searchers who win the auction on OEV
Network.

For dApps, OEV is an extension to base feeds, supported by Api3ReaderProxyV1
contract. This contract is a simple proxy that reads the value either from the
base feed or the OEV feed, whatever is fresher.

<!-- NOTE: Source = https://excalidraw.com/#json=YBOgsQx3LnXa_ct_qkAUr,W0k3A5A4Ln6BhECwl4OB6A -->
<img src="./oev-proxy.svg" />

The OEV feed is specific to the dApp and its update only reflects the price for
the dApp which uses this proxy. This is accomplished by proxy having an
immutable dApp ID field. This allows for separate auctions being held for each
dApp.

To guarantee searchers exclusivity privilege to capture OEV, the base feed
updates are delayed. Searchers are bidding for real-time data and by winning an
auction, searcher is guaranteed that the data is fresher than the base feed.

### OEV Feed

OEV feed is derived from the base feed by changing its beacons to OEV beacons.

An OEV beacon is derived from the base beacon by hashing its' template ID using
`keccak256`. This makes it possible to share the signed data for OEV beacons
freely, because they can't be used to update the base feed. The
Api3ServerV1OevExtension contract only allows them to be used by the auction
winner provided they paid the correct amount.

::: info

**Example:**

Say we have the following base feed beacon:

```json
"0xfe395743aff41835420d109be4bf98b93e9d9670f5539fc6392578b4626ecedf": {
  "airnode": "0xc52EeA00154B4fF1EbbF8Ba39FDe37F1AC3B9Fd4",
  "templateId": "0x1bb9efc88ac9d910a9edc28e8cad8959d196a551e15c9af3af21247f1605873f",
}
```

To derive the template ID of the OEV beacon, we hash it's template ID:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes32(0x1bb9efc88ac9d910a9edc28e8cad8959d196a551e15c9af3af21247f1605873f)))
// Output: 0xbc7896315bfd4b1186a05f219ec71a95def0d038617e7ae534075317866bfd1b
```

Which gives us the following OEV beacon:

```json
"0x154ca7c81eb1ed9ce151d5b6ad894c5ab79d19bee20d89eb061aaf24f788221f": {
  "airnode": "0xc52EeA00154B4fF1EbbF8Ba39FDe37F1AC3B9Fd4",
  "templateId": "0xbc7896315bfd4b1186a05f219ec71a95def0d038617e7ae534075317866bfd1b",
}
```

Notice that the beacon ID is different, but the Airnode address is the same.

The OEV update flow is explained more in depth in
[OEV Searching](/oev/searchers/oev-searching).

### dApp Sources

Searchers need to know the proxy address and the underlying dAPI name used by
the OEV proxy. The dApps have full control over what proxies they use, so it's
best to refer to their documentation or inspect their contracts to get
up-to-date proxy address.

To determine the underlying beacons used by the dAPI, you can use the
AirseekerRegistry contract on the target chain.

#### Data feed details encoding

The AirseekerRegistry contract uses a particular encoding for data feed details
so that the details can be persisted on-chain as a single `bytes` value. The
callers need to decode this value to get the actual data feed details.

Decoding depends on whether the feed is a beacon or a beacon set. Assume we have
encoded `dataFeedDetails` and we need to decode it. Note, the encoding follows a
similar principle.

The decoding of a beacon:

```solidity
(address airnode, bytes32 templateId) = abi.decode(
  dataFeedDetails,
  (address, bytes32)
);
```

The decoding of a beacon set:

```solidity
(address[] memory airnodes, bytes32[] memory templateIds) = abi.decode(
  dataFeedDetails,
  (address[], bytes32[])
);
```

To know which encoding to use, you can check the length of the
`dataFeedDetails`. For single beacon, the length is always `64` bytes, because
both `address` and `bytes32` are encoding using 32 bytes. For beacon set, the
length depends on the number of beacons encoded.

#### Example

Say there is a dApp proxy which uses the `ETH/USD` dAPI. We can compute the
details for this dAPI off-chain by:

```js
const encodedDapiName = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String('ETH/USD'); // 0x4554482f55534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
const encodedDapiNameHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(encodedDapiName); // 0x9e6138f8f57d7b493a8364edb0a0ac92399dfd890eecb9121050836a1749ba42
```

To determine the data feed ID for this dAPI, we can use the
`dapiNameHashToDataFeedId` function on the Api3ServerV1 contract:

```js
const api3ServerV1 = new ethers.Contract(
  api3ServerV1Address,
  api3ServerV1Abi,
  provider
);
const dataFeedId =
  await api3ServerV1.dapiNameHashToDataFeedId(encodedDapiNameHash); // e.g. 0x28d7af9ef50bde705ccabb77f27cfa481b998a4a01eaae22825835f611bf7ffe
```

To determine the data feed details, use the `dataFeedIdToDetails` function on
the AirseekerRegistry contract:

```js
const airseekerRegistry = new ethers.Contract(
  airseekerRegistryAddress,
  airseekerRegistryAbi,
  provider
);
const dataFeedDetails = await airseekerRegistry.dataFeedIdToDetails(dataFeedId);
```

The data feed details need to be decoded first. The following is a simplified
version of that decodes the data off-chain:

```js
const deriveBeaconId = (airnodeAddress, templateId) => {
  return ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
    ['address', 'bytes32'],
    [airnodeAddress, templateId]
  );
};

const decodeDataFeedDetails = (dataFeed) => {
  // The contract returns empty bytes if the data feed is not registered.
  if (dataFeed === '0x') return null;

  // This is a hex encoded string, the contract works with bytes directly
  // 2 characters for the '0x' preamble + 32 * 2 hexadecimals for 32 bytes + 32 * 2 hexadecimals for 32 bytes
  if (dataFeed.length === 2 + 32 * 2 + 32 * 2) {
    const [airnodeAddress, templateId] = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.decode(
      ['address', 'bytes32'],
      dataFeed
    );

    const dataFeedId = deriveBeaconId(airnodeAddress, templateId);
    return [{ beaconId: dataFeedId, airnodeAddress, templateId }];
  }

  const [airnodeAddresses, templateIds] = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.decode(
    ['address[]', 'bytes32[]'],
    dataFeed
  );

  const beacons = airnodeAddresses.map((airnodeAddress, idx) => {
    const templateId = templateIds[idx];
    const beaconId = deriveBeaconId(airnodeAddress, templateId);

    return { beaconId, airnodeAddress, templateId };
  });

  return beacons;
};
```

Say the following is the output after decoding the data feed details:

```json

  {
    "beaconId": "0x853a5cc0a517489779025cc8a48e771461a0616665efd6a61424e57997e6dbed",

```

Searchers need to monitor these data sources with the public Signed APIs. Note,
that these are the base feed data feeds and the searcher is expected to derive
the OEV feeds to monitor the OEV data.

## Public Signed APIs

Signed APIs store the data pushed by Airnode feeds and expose them to the public
via an API. As mentioned, base feed updates are permissionless and can be update
by anyone. The OEV feed data can only be used by OEV auction winner. API3 runs
Signed APIs and makes them publicly available. They deployed on AWS, ensuring
maximum uptime and reliability.

Signed APIs only support querying data for a particular Airnode. The Airnode
address is supplied as HTTP path parameter. The endpoint is cached and can be
called repeatedly. However, too drastic call usage is punished by a rate
limiting or full access denial.

<!-- TODO: Make sure NOT to call "base feed updates" as "regular updates" -->

<!-- TODO: Make sure to refer to Airnode feed as "Airnode feed" not "Airnode" -->

### Base Feed Endpoints

The following are the base feed endpoints that are publicly available:

1. `https://signed-api.api3.org/public/<AIRNODE_ADDRESS>` - The official API3
   Signed APIs used by the push oracle to update the base feeds.

For example, see the
[API3 response for Nodary Airnode](https://signed-api.api3.org/public/0xc52EeA00154B4fF1EbbF8Ba39FDe37F1AC3B9Fd4).

### OEV Endpoints

The following are the OEV endpoints that are publicly available:

1. `https://signed-api.api3.org/public-oev/<AIRNODE_ADDRESS>`

For example, see the
[API3 response for Nodary Airnode](https://signed-api.api3.org/public-oev/0xc52EeA00154B4fF1EbbF8Ba39FDe37F1AC3B9Fd4).

### Response

The response of the Signed API is a JSON object with the following fields:

1. `count` - The number of signed data entries.
2. `data` - An object with the signed data entries. The keys are the beacon IDs
   and the values are the signed data objects for the particular beacon(s).

For example:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "data": {
    "0xcdaf3ecba9e3f1457b64b1dd33dd6dbd5d3a0d43dbcb6b94fbf755ca8a64f1c2": {
