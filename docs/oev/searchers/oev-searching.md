# OEV Searching

We assume that a searcher has an existing MEV bot and is familiar with API3 OEV
solution. Let's detail the steps to transition from MEV to OEV searching.

## Depositing Funds

To be eligible to win OEV auctions, searchers need to have enough collateral
deposited in the OevAuctionHouse contract. See
[Bid Eligibility](/oev/overview/oev-auctioneer.md#bid-eligibility) for more
details.

We recommend using the same hot wallet for the bot on the OEV network (to
participate in auctions) and the target chain (to capture the OEV). To deposit
funds, you can use either the `deposit` or `depositForBidder` functions. The
latter allows you to deposit the collateral on behalf of another address.

For an advanced usage where the bidder is a contract, refer to
[Bidding Contract](/oev/searchers/oev-searching#bidding-contract).

## Withdrawing Funds

To withdraw the deposited collateral from OevAuctionHouse contract, the searcher
needs to do the following:

1. Call `initiateWithdrawal` function on the OevAuctionHouse contract.
2. Wait for the withdrawal period to pass. The period is 15 seconds.
3. Call `withdraw` function on the OevAuctionHouse contract.

The withdrawal process is implemented this way to prevent denying service by
frontrunning the award transaction by withdrawing the collateral.

## Monitoring Signed Data

Searchers should periodically call the public
[OEV Endpoints](/oev/overview/target-chain.md#oev-endpoints) to get the
real-time values for the dAPIs used by the dApp. The dApp will use a proxy to
read the dAPI value, which prefers the fresher out of the base feed updates and
OEV updates.

### Querying Signed APIs

For each tracked beacon, searchers need to derive the corresponding
[OEV Beacon](/oev/overview/target-chain.md#oev-beacons).

Then, simply call the OEV Signed API endpoints for the various Airnodes and pick
the signed data for the required OEV beacons. It's necessary to persist these
values for a brief period of time - in case they win the auction and need to
update the data feed.

OEV auctions provide exclusivity guarantees only for data points with timestamps
within the bidding phase. Note, that for older signed data, there may be
previous auction winner who can also use them to update the feed. Moreover, it's
not possible to use data fresher than the end of the bidding phase. This is to
ensure the same guarantees apply for the subsequent auction winner. This means
that there is little reason to store data for longer than a single auction.

### Simulating a Data Feed Update

Compared to the base feed updates, OEV updates are permissioned - allowing only
the auction winner to update the data feed. This makes the OEV updates
impossible to simulate on-chain. However, simulating the data feed updates on
chain is a really powerful concept because searchers don't need to replicate
complex on-chain logic off-chain, but instead attempt to update the feed(s) and
see how it affects the dApp (without actually making any state changes).

This is built in to the protocol and works via `simulateDappOevDataFeedUpdate`
and `simulateExternalCall` functions, which can be called only with
`address(0)`. The only way to impersonate a zero address is during staticcall
simulation. The intended usage is to do a multicall that simulates the data feed
update(s) then makes arbitrary number external calls.

To understand how to construct the payload for data feed simulation, refer to
[Update the Data Feed](/oev/overview/target-chain.md#updating-the-data-feed)
section.

```js
const signedDataCollection = [...] // Assume we have the signed data for the beacons.

// 1. Create the calldata for the dApp OEV data feed updates.
const dAppOevDataFeedUpdateCalldata = []
for (const signedData of signedDataCollection) {
  dAppOevDataFeedUpdateCalldata.push(
    api3ServerV1OevExtension.interface.encodeFunctionData(
      'simulateDappOevDataFeedUpdate',
      [dAppId, signedData]
    )
  );
}

// 2. Create the calldata for the external calls.
const externalCallsCalldata = [...] // E.g. Liquidation calls.

// 3. Impersonate the zero address and simulate the data feed update.
const api3ServerV1OevExtensionImpersonated = api3ServerV1OevExtension.connect(
  ethers.constants.AddressZero
);

// 4. Simulate the data feed update and external calls.
const simulationResult = await api3ServerV1OevExtensionImpersonated.multicall.staticcall(
  ...dAppOevDataFeedUpdateCalldata,
  ...externalCallsCalldata
);
```

## Collateral and Protocol Fee

For a searcher to win an auction, they are required to have enough ETH deposited
in the OevAuctionHouse contract. Similarly, the value the searcher can win is
limited by the amount they have deposited. Refer to
[Bid Eligibility](/oev/overview/oev-auctioneer.md#bid-eligibility) for details.

The collateral and protocol fee rates are configurable parameters within the
OevAuctionHouse contract and are configured by the API3 DAO. These values are
set in "basis points", which are 1/100th of a percentage point. For example, a
value of 1000 is equivalent to 10%. The current values are set to the following:

| Parameter                | Value |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| collateralInBasisPoints  | 1000  |
| protocolFeeInBasisPoints | 0     |

The collateral and the protocol fee are calculated using the price feed values
at the time of the bid placement. However, the collateral is reserved at award
time. This allows the bidder to place multiple bids for different dApps, even if
their collateral doesn't allow them to win all. This allows for greater
flexibility.

If the auction winner pays for the bid on the OEV Network and report the
fulfillment, their collateral is released and the protocol fee is deducted. If
the auction winner doesn't pay for the award or fails to report the fulfillment,
their collateral is slashed.

## Placing a Bid

After a profitable opportunity is identified, the searcher needs to place a bid
to obtain a signature that allows them to perform the update for real. To place
a bid, call `placeBidWithExpiration` or `placeBid`. The latter is just a
convenience function which places a bid with maximum expiration time. It's
recommended to call `placeBidWithExpiration` and set the expiration time to the
end of the next bidding phase.

The `placeBidWithExpiration` accepts the following parameters:

| Argument             | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bidTopic             | bytes32 | The [Bid Topic](/oev/overview/oev-auctioneer.md#bid-topic) of the current auction.                                                                                                                                           |
| chainId              | uint256 | The chain ID of the target chain.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| bidAmount            | uint256 | The amount of the bid in the native currency of the target chain. At award time, a respective percentage fo this amount is reserved as collateral and the winner is expected to pay the full bid amount on the target chain. |
| bidDetails           | bytes   | The [Bid details](/oev/overview/oev-auctioneer.md#bid-details) of the bid.                                                                                                                                                   |
| maxCollateralAmount  | uint256 | The maximum collateral amount that the bidder is willing to lock up. This is to prevent unwanted slippage in case of a large price change before the transaction is mined.                                                   |
| maxProtocolFeeAmount | uint256 | The maximum protocol fee amount that the bidder is willing to pay. This is to prevent unwanted slippage in case of a large price change before the transaction is mined.                                                     |
| expirationTimestamp  | uint32  | The timestamp until which the bid is valid. The timestamp is checked against the `block.timestamp` at the bid placement time. Minimum is 15 seconds and maximum 24 hours.                                                    |

The most intuitive way to place the bid is follow the recommendations above and
as a bid amount provide a percentage of the profit. Note, that the searcher
needs to be mindful of all the gas costs on both the target chain and OEV
Network, the paid bid amount and the respective collateral and protocol fee.

For a bid to be valid, it needs to use the correct arguments. Out of these, the
most important is the bid topic, which also identifies the auction. For the bid
to be considered, the place bid transaction needs to be mined during the bidding
phase. Searchers should be mindful of the block time on the OEV Network to make
sure their transaction is mined in time. Refer to
[OEV Network Properties](/oev/overview/oev-network.md#properties) for details.

## Waiting for Auction Award

Immediately after the bidding phase is over, Auctioneer enters the award phase
and determines the highest bidder and submits the `awardBid` transaction, which
emits AwardedBid event. This event indexes the the three most important
arguments:

- `bidder` - The auction winner.
- `bidTopic` - The bid topic of the auction.
- `bidId` - The bid ID of the auction.

Searchers can create an event filter to query for all their awarded bids by
filtering for particular bidder(s) or they could create event filter for
specific auction or simply query for their bid. The most idiomatic way is to
poll the AwardedBid with a particular bid topic. After the event is received,
searchers can check the bidder to see if they are the winner or not. It's
recommended to use a small polling interval to obtain the result as soon as
possible.

Auctioneer should in practice award the bid during the award phase, but
searchers are recommended to poll longer. In case Auctioneer does not even
within the next bidding phase - there is likely something wrong. Whether the
issue is caused by Auctioneer or the searcher can be determined by looking at
the OEV Network. In case, the issue was caused by Auctioneer, the searcher can
open a dispute.

::: info

Searchers can monitor the auction in real-time and can determine the auction
winner themselves (or even attempt to increase their bid).

:::

## Capturing OEV

After the bid is awarded, the searcher needs to do the following:

1. Pay for the awarded bid.
2. Update any of the dApp's data feed(s).
3. Capture any OEV opportunities exposed by the data feed update(s).

It's expected that searchers do all of these steps atomically. However, the
contract allows searcher to repeat steps 2. and 3. as many times as they want.
However, each update has to increase the timestamp of the OEV Beacon(s).

The OEV capabilities are enabled by the
[Api3ServerV1OevExtension](https://github.com/api3dao/contracts-qs/blob/main/contracts/api3-server-v1/Api3ServerV1OevExtension.sol).
This contract allows the auction winner to pay for the winning bid and update
the data feed values.

### Paying for the OEV Bid

To pay for the winning bid, call the `payOevBid` function. This function
requires the following parameters:

1. `uint256 dappId` - The ID of the dApp that the searcher wants to update. This
   is the same value which they've used in the bid topic.
2. `uint32 signedDataTimestampCutoff` - The signed data timestamp cutoff period.
   This is the same value, which they've used in the bid topic.
3. `bytes calldata signature` - The signature that the auction winner received
   as an award. This is obtained from the event emitted on the OEV Network after
   Auctioneer awarded the bid.

The signature is crafted for a specific dApp ID and signed data timestamp
cutoff. If the searcher provides incorrect values, the signature verification
will fail, causing the transaction to revert. If the signature is valid, the
contract allows the sender to update the data feed. Due to exclusivity
guarantees, the winner is guaranteed to be who can update the feed with the data
from within the bidding phase of the respective auction.

### Updating the Data Feed

To update the data feed values, call the `updateDappOevDataFeed` function. This
requires the sender to be whitelisted by paying for the OEV bid first. The
function requires the following parameters:

1. `uint256 dappId` - The ID of the dApp that the searcher wants to update.
2. `bytes[] calldata signedData` - The ABI encoded signed data that the searcher
   wants to update the dAPI with. The contract decodes the following fields:
   - `address airnode` - The address of the Airnode.
   - `bytes32 templateId` - The template ID of the base beacon - **not** the
     template ID of the OEV beacon.
   - `uint256 timestamp` - The timestamp of the data.
   - `bytes memory data` - The encoded value.
   - `bytes memory signature` - The signature for this signed data - signed for
     the base beacon.

::: info

**Important**

It might be a bit surprising to pass the template ID of the base feed beacon,
because the data and the signature are supplied for the OEV beacon. However, the
contract needs to know both. While hashing the base feed template ID to obtain
the template ID of the OEV beacon is possible - "un-hashing" the base feed
template ID from the OEV template ID is not.

Say the searcher wants to update the value of base feed beacon with template ID
`0x1bb9efc88ac9d910a9edc28e8cad8959d196a551e15c9af3af21247f1605873f` and they
want to use the following signed data for the OEV beacon:

```json
"0x154ca7c81eb1ed9ce151d5b6ad894c5ab79d19bee20d89eb061aaf24f788221f": {
  "airnode": "0xc52EeA00154B4fF1EbbF8Ba39FDe37F1AC3B9Fd4",
  "encodedValue": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003f9c9ba19d0d78",
  "signature": "0xf5f454722652215823cb868fd53b7a0c63090dff46e65ba7cdd5fb120df3a520522b80b1fa41f2599c429daa0e48c4f42f60f25b41dab3a8a9be1d2547ebe9811b",
  "templateId": "0xbc7896315bfd4b1186a05f219ec71a95def0d038617e7ae534075317866bfd1b",
  "timestamp": "1726474901"
}
```

they would encode the signed data as follows:

```solidity
abi.encode(
  address(0xc52EeA00154B4fF1EbbF8Ba39FDe37F1AC3B9Fd4),
  bytes32(0x1bb9efc88ac9d910a9edc28e8cad8959d196a551e15c9af3af21247f1605873f),
  uint256(1726474901),
  hex"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003f9c9ba19d0d78",
  hex"f5f454722652215823cb868fd53b7a0c63090dff46e65ba7cdd5fb120df3a520522b80b1fa41f2599c429daa0e48c4f42f60f25b41dab3a8a9be1d2547ebe9811b"
)
```

:::

The auction winner can update the data feed multiple times and in multiple
transactions. However, the contract enforces tight security measures. The
timestamp of the signed data for OEV beacon must be greater or equal to the
timestamp of the base feed beacon. The data feed value after aggregating OEV
beacons must change the base feed - either increase the timestamp or change the
aggregated value. This enforces time monotonicity at the contract level, making
sure OEV updates provide only the freshest data.

### Api3ReaderProxyV1

<!-- TODO: This is only relevant for the dApps -->

The
[Api3ReaderProxyV1](https://github.com/api3dao/contracts-qs/blob/main/contracts/api3-server-v1/proxies/Api3ReaderProxyV1.sol)
contract is a ChainLink compatible proxy with OEV built-in internally. There are
no changes required from the dApp's perspective to integrate OEV, which reads
the value via the `read` function.

Internally, this proxy uses the `Api3ServerV1` and `Api3ServerV1OevExtension`
contracts to read the base feed and OEV value respectively, with a preference
for the fresher out of the two.

## Bidding Contract

The bidder can be either EoA or a contract. The former is simpler, but has
certain drawbacks. Imagine a searcher firm, where individual developers work on
the searcher bots. Each bot has a dedicated EoA to interact with OEV Network and
capture OEV on the target chain. The product owner only provides liquidity to
each EoA for the OEV collateral. There are a few immediate drawbacks:

1. The EoA needs has full control over the deposit in OevAuctionHouse contract.
2. The collateral liquidity is fragmented across multiple EoA.

Both of these downsides can be mitigated by a role-based bidding contract. One
can imagine the product owner being the only one who can withdraw the funds and
give bidding permissions to other accounts. These accounts can be used to place
bids through the contract. The contract can have other use cases based on the
use cases needed, but there are a few important consiederations to keep in mind
when designing the contract:

1. The OevAuctionsHouse expects the same account to call `reportFulfillment`.
   This means the bidding contract needs to be reporting fulfillments as well.
2. Both `initiateWithdrawal`, `withdraw` and `cancelWithdrawal` need to be
   called by the the same address. The bidding contract need to be allowed to
   call of this. Note that withdrawal cancelation may be omitted if the contract
   doesn't need to have this capability. Access to these functions should be
   limited. For example, a malicious actor that has access to it may call
   `initiateWithdrawal` so that the auctioneer bots disregard the respective
   bids, or call `cancelWithdrawal` whenever a withdrawal is initiated to
   prevent the funds from ever being withdrawn.
3. The withdrawal recipient is specified in the `withdraw` call. Make sure the
   recipient is payable and the funds will not remain locked.

## Handling Disputes

In case of a dispute, the OEV Network is considered source-of-truth and can be
used to resolve it. This may include Auctioneer awarding the wrong bidder or
being inconsistent to its pre-announced rules.

Note, that any dispute that can't be proven or disproved on-chain is
non-applicable. This may include searchers complaints about the RPC connection
or similar off-chain problems.

To open a dispute head out to the
[OEV Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/758003776174030948/1062909222347603989)
and create a post with the description of the dispute.
