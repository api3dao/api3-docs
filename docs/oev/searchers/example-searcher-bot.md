# Example Searcher Bot

To experience the OEV extraction process, we've prepared an example bot that
implements all of the steps discussed in the docs to capture OEV liquidations
for the Orbit protocol. The bot focuses on positions, which can be captured by
the price of ETH increasing.

See the
[GitHub implementation](https://github.com/api3dao/oev-orbit-bot-example) for
details.
