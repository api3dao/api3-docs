## Adding markdown

You can use markdown on this page. Learn more about other home page features
[here](https://vitepress.dev/reference/default-theme-home-page). When using home
page features the framework will manage the flex alignment of the content for
you.

## Links

`<a href="/oev/">OEV</a>`

You can do these but be sure the SPA does not reload. This one works.
<a href="/oev/">OEV</a>

## Vue components

Custom Vue component can also be added to the Home page as well.
[See this on in GitHub](https://github.com/api3dao/oev-docs/blob/main/docs/_components/EthersAbiCoder.vue).
Let me know if you need help to build one.

<EthersAbiCoder/>
